The goal of [quick-guide] is to compile information about IT-related tasks and
to provide succinct instructions that enable users to replicate these tasks
efficiently, without the need for extensive textual explanations. The main
format of this repository is [Markdown] and the preferred language is English
(US).

The main focus lies on:

- [Development/ Dev](Dev)
- [System Administration/ DevOps](DevOps)

Throughout this guide, examples of the use of free and open source software
(FOSS) are provided. FOSS refers to software that is made available to the
public under a license that allows users to study, modify, and redistribute the
software without restriction. FOSS is often developed collaboratively by a
community of developers and users who contribute to the development and
improvement of the software. Examples of popular FOSS projects include the
Linux operating system, the Apache web server, and the Firefox web browser.
FOSS is often contrasted with proprietary software, which is owned by a company
and typically has restrictions on how it can be used and modified. The concept
of FOSS promotes collaboration, innovation, and accessibility, and has been
instrumental in advancing the fields of software development and technology.
