## Introduction

Source code hosting is a fundamental service that organizations and projects
must consider for effective management. While some newer Version Control
Systems (_VCS_), such as _Git_, incorporate built-in hosting features, scaling
access management often requires source code servers. These servers act as
intermediaries between developers and repositories. For _VCS_ like _SVN_ or
_CVS_, centralized source code management was the sole option. However, _Git_
and similar systems are decentralized. Manual management of these distributed
repositories becomes overly complex as an organization or project expands.
Despite _Git's_ decentralized nature, most organizations and projects opt for a
centralized server infrastructure. The choice between onsite hosting or
third-party hosting depends on the organization's IT infrastructure and the
confidentiality of the source code. Third-party hosting often involves
platforms like <https://github.com>, though numerous solutions exist for both
third-party and self-hosting as Free Open Source Software (_FOSS_). This
document compiles Free Open Source Software options for hosting source code
projects.
