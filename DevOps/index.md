__DevOps__ is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and
information-technology operations[^1] (Ops) which aims to _shorten_ the systems
development life cycle and provide _continuous_ delivery with high software
quality. [ðŸ¡º wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps)

[^1]: The term _information-technology operations (Ops)_ is linked in wikipedia
to [Data Center
Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center_management#Operations)
which is translated into only _Bahasa Indonesia_ and no other language (at the
time of writing 2020-02-19). Strange isn't it? In the German version of DevOps
in [ðŸ¡º Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) the term _System
Administration_ is used.
