## Introduction

Urlwatch is a handy utility for monitoring changes on web pages and notifying
system administrators of updates. It's particularly useful for keeping track of
important information on websites that don't provide RSS feeds or other forms
of notification. Developed as a script in Python, _urlwatch_ is designed to be
simple, yet powerful, offering extensive customization options for system
administrators.

With _urlwatch_, you can:

- Monitor multiple URLs for changes.
- Receive notifications via email or other configurable methods
- Customize the way changes are detected using filters and hooks.

This step-by-step guide will walk you through the installation, configuration,
and usage of _urlwatch_ on a Debian system.

## Installation

Installing urlwatch on a Debian system is straightforward. Follow these steps
to get urlwatch up and running:

1. **Update Your System:**

   Before installing any new package, it's a good practice to update your
   package list to ensure you have the latest information on available
   packages.

   ```bash
   aptitude update
   ```

2. **Install urlwatch:**

   Urlwatch can be installed directly from the Debian repositories using the
   APT package manager.

   ```bash
   aptitude install urlwatch
   ```

   This will install `/usr/bin/urlwatch` and files in standard locations like
   `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/urlwatch` and `/usr/share/doc/urlwatch`.


3. **Verify the Installation:**

   After the installation is complete, you can verify that urlwatch is
   installed correctly by checking its version. However unlike the
   bare evocation of `urlwatch` this step will not create any files.

   ```bash
   urlwatch --version
   ```

By following these steps, you'll have urlwatch installed on your Debian
system, ready to configure and use for monitoring web page changes.

### Basic Configuration

Once you have urlwatch installed, the next step is to configure it to monitor
web pages. The basic configuration involves setting up a list of URLs to watch
and running the tool to check for changes. Follow these steps for a simple
configuration:

1. **Initial Setup:**

   Run one of the following two commands to create the necessary configuration
   files in your home directory:

   ```bash
   urlwatch
   ```

   ```bash
   urlwatch --edit
   ```

   Either of this commands will generate a default configuration for urlwatch
   located in the following files under the `~/.urlwatch` directory.

   - `~/.cache/urlwatch/cache.db`
   - `~/.config/urlwatch/urlwatch.yaml`
   - `~/.config/urlwatch/urls.yaml`

  Other files like `hooks.py` are not created automatically. The `cache.db`
  is a SQLite3 database. It is possible to use other database, but this
  is not covered in this section.

  While it is nice that there many entries in `urlwatch.yaml` to give ideas
what is possible to configure, it is too much for a basic configuration.
Therefore the best way for now is either to delete the content and start from
scratch or comment out all if not most of its content. This section will not
touch the default example configuration content.

2. **Edit the URL List:**

   Open the `urls.yaml` file in your preferred text editor. This file contains
   the list of URLs you want to monitor. Here's an example of how to add a URL to
   this file:

   ```yaml
   name: "urlwatch version"
   url: "https://thp.io/2008/urlwatch/"
   filter:
     - html2text
     - grep: "urlwatch-.*.tar.gz"
     - strip
   ---
   ```

   You can add as many URLs as you need, each defined with its own `url` and an
   optional `name` for identification.

   The strip filter in the configuration is used to remove any leading or
   trailing whitespace from the lines that remain after the html2text and grep
   filters are applied. This helps in cleaning up the output by ensuring there
   are no unnecessary spaces at the beginning or end of each line, making the
   output more readable and precise.

3. **Run urlwatch:**

   To understand if the configuration is correct, list the jobs:

   ```bash
   urlwatch --list
   1: urlwatch webpage ( https://thp.io/2008/urlwatch/ )
   ```

   Then to understand if the filter is actually filtering, do:

   ```bash
   urlwatch --test-filter 1
   urlwatch-2.28.tar.gz (2022-05-03)
   ```

   After adding your URLs, run urlwatch to start monitoring, first in
   verbose mode.

   **First run:**

   ```

   The tool will check the listed URLs for changes and output the results to
   the terminal in colored diff format.

   Unfortunately, if you are using this on external web pages that are
   changing seldom, you will not see the diff output. For this example
   a new urlwatch release would be needed to be announced on that page.
   However we can have 3 different outcomes from a urlwatch run:

   1. New
   2. NotModifiedError aka nothing has changed
   3. Changed

   The following grep on my web page will for example show a diff output,
   because I changed the page in-between 2 runs of urlwatch.

   ```yaml
   name: "urlwatch cki"
   url: "https://christian.kuelker.info"
   filter:
     - html2text
     - grep: "Last modified:.*"
     - strip
   ---
   ```

   ```bash
   urlwatch
   ===========================================================================
   01. CHANGED: urlwatch cki
   ===========================================================================

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   CHANGED: urlwatch cki ( https://christian.kuelker.info )

   ```

   However, this would actually not be a good method to understand if a random
   sub page under <https://christian.kuelker.info> has changed, as this
   modified date changes per page update. Therefore it is utmost important to
   understand what the meaning of parts of the web page actually are. In this
   case the side bar under "Latest" would update, if there is a new page, but
   not the page specific modification date.

4. **View Notifications:**

   By default, urlwatch will output the changes directly to the terminal. If
   there are changes detected on the monitored web pages, they will be
   displayed in the command output in diff format..

This basic setup will get you started with urlwatch, allowing you to monitor
web pages for changes with minimal configuration. For more advanced options,
you can explore additional filters and hooks in the configuration files.
