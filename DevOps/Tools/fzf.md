description: Search or match a list in a fuzzy way

---

`fzf` is an interactive filter program that can be used to search for items in
a list. For example, it can be used to interactively match filenames in a list
of files.

1. Interactive interface: `fzf` provides an easy way to search through large
   collections of files, command histories, and other types of data.

3. Customizable: `fzf` is customizable via environment variables
   `FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` and `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`, allowing users to configure it
   to suit their specific needs. It has a wide range of options that can be
   used to add functionality and integrate with other tools.

4. Some external programs, like `zsh`, `vim` and `tmux` have plugins to
   interact with `fzf`.

   - `fzf-tab`: Replace zsh's default completion selection menu with `fzf`!
   - `fzf-tmux`: <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/tree/master/bin>
   - `fzf.vim`: <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim>

5. Versatile: fzf can be used for a variety of tasks, such as navigating files,
   searching command history, selecting processes to kill, and more. It can
   also be integrated with other tools such as vim, tmux, and zsh.

## Installation

    aptitude install fzf

## Source

Source: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf

## Usage

### Safe Results in a File

Search for 'book' in PDF files interactively and save the result in
`results.txt`:

```bash
# Run
find / -name "*.pdf*"|fzf > results.txt
# Then type 'book'
# The results are displayed in a list with one line highlighted.
# Press <ENTER> to save that line into 'results.txt' and end the fzf session
```

### Select Command History

This example will display your command history and allow you to search through
it using fzf. You can then select a command and press enter to execute it.

```bash
history | fzf
```

### Edit the Result in One Go

This example will open the file you select in `vim`. You can use `fzf` to
quickly search and select the file you want to open.

```bash
# This will search all files below the current directory
# The selected file will be opened in vim
fzf --print0 | xargs -0 -o vim
# The same, shorter, but less robust would be
vim $(fzf)
```

### Chaining patterns

You can use the interactive technique above to search for complex things.

1. Find a file that contains exactly the word 'book'
2. And is a Markdown file
3. And the path starts with 'scratch'

You would enter interactively

    'book .md$ ^scratch

This could for example give file `scratch/todo/books-to-write.md`.

| fzf      | Kind of matching            | Notes                              |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| smthng   | fuzzy-match                 | Items that match smthng            |
| 'calm    | exact-match (quoted)        | Items that include calm            |
| ^movie   | prefix-exact-match          | Items that start with movie        |
| .pdf$    | suffix-exact-match          | Items that end with .pdf           |
| !water   | inverse-exact-match         | Items that do not include water    |
| !^movie  | inverse-prefix-exact-match  | Items that do not start with movie |
| !.pdf$   | inverse-suffix-exact-match  | Items that do not end with .pdf    |

### Change Directories

This example should not be taken too serious. This command will allow you to
quickly navigate your file system using `fzf`. It will list all directories
under the current directory and allow you to select one to change into. However
it also will display dot-files. So that is basically useless in `~/` or a git
repository.

```bash
cd $(find . -type d -print 2>/dev/null | fzf)
```

This improved example is similar to the previous one, but it uses the -not
-path `*/\.*` option to exclude directories that begin with a dot (i.e.,
dot-files). This ensures that only visible directories are displayed in the
`fzf` interface, making it easier to navigate the file system.

```bash
cd $(find . -type d -not -path '*/\.*' -print 2>/dev/null | fzf)
```

### Select Git Commit and Show the Commit

```bash
git show "$(git log --oneline | fzf | awk '{print $1}')"
```

This command shows the list of Git commits in the current repository using `git
log --oneline`, filters them using `fzf`, extracts the commit hash using `awk`,
and then displays the selected commit using `git show`.
