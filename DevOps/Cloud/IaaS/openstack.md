## Introduction

OpenStack, abbreviated as O~S, is an open-source cloud computing platform,
licensed under Apache 2.0. Primarily used as an infrastructure-as-a-service
(IaaS) solution, it's implemented in both public and private cloud environments
to provide users with virtual servers and other resources. This software
platform includes interconnected components that manage a variety of hardware
resources – such as processing, storage, and networking – across a data center.
It can be administered using a web-based dashboard, command-line tools, or
RESTful web services. (→ [Wikipedia OpenStack], 2024)
