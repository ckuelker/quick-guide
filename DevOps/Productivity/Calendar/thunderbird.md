## Introduction

While Thunderbird is primarily recognized as an email client, it also features
a unique calendar mode. Distinctively, this calendar mode is designed as a web
page and is seamlessly delivered through Chrome. Due to this tight integration,
many users might not even realize that Thunderbird functions as a local web
application. This document is intended to offer useful tips for maximizing the
use and configuration of the Thunderbird calendar.

## Change the Date Format

By default, Thunderbird's date formatting adheres to the locale setting of the
operating system. For instance, if you're using the locale `en_us.UTF8`, you'll
encounter dates in the format "2023/07/30". But if you're utilizing the German
locale, it'll display as "30.07.2023". Now, what if you wish to employ the ISO
format while retaining the German language setting? Contrary to the Evolution
email client, Thunderbird's standard configuration dialog doesn't readily
support this preference.

__Solution 1:__ Opt for a locale that supports your desired short date format.

__Solution 2:__ This is specifically for users with Thunderbird version 91 or
later:

1. Open the `Config Editor` by navigating to Preferences > General. Scroll down
to the bottom of the page.

2. Adjust the setting `intl.regional_prefs.use_os_locales` to `false`.

    ```
    intl.regional_prefs.use_os_locales = false
    ```

3. Next, alter `intl.date_time.pattern_override.date_short` to the string value
   "`yyyy-MM-dd`".

    ```
    intl.date_time.pattern_override.date_short = yyyy-MM-dd
    ```

[guide](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/customize-date-time-formats-thunderbird).

## Change the Calendar Font Size

Although users can adjust the font and its size in the 'Preferences General'
setting of the Thunderbird application, it doesn't affect the calendar. For
instance, on Debian 12 Bookworm under MATE, the default font is Cantarell at a
size of 17, relatively large. To display four calendar entries spaced 15
minutes apart within a single hour, users either need to significantly zoom in
or the display splits into two columns. Notably, unlike in Evolution, setting
the time division to 15 minutes doesn't alter this behavior.

As there's no direct configuration option to adjust the calendar font or size,
users need to employ a workaround by modifying the application's underlying
CSS.

To identify the current settings and values, initiate Thunderbird with web
tools using:` thunderbird --devtools`

1. Enable a Custom CSS File

   Navigate to the `Config Editor` and configure
   `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `true`.

    ```
    toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets = true
    ```

2. Set Up an Empty CSS File

   Create an empty file named `userChrome.css` inside the `chrome` directory.

    ```bash
    cd ~/.thunderbird/*.default-default
    mkdir chrome
    cd chrome
    touch useChrome.css
    ```

3. Test the CSS Integration

   To verify Thunderbird's use of the file, add a test CSS rule. For instance,
   adjusting the size of the calendar day header:

   ```css
    .day-column-container {
       font-size: 12px;
    }
    ```

   It's advisable to utilize the development tools and the inspector to check
   __computed__ values before and after modifications to discern any changes.
   However, be mindful that the application's HTML and CSS might evolve over
   time.

4. Address the Font Size Issue

   To remedy the specific font size concern, reduce the font size from 17.333px
   to 16px and eliminate some padding. The original `.day-column-container`
   setting can be discarded.

   ```css
   .calendar-item-flex {
        padding-top: 0px !important;
        padding-bottom: 0px !important;
        row-gap: 2px !important;
    }
    .event-name-label {
        font-weight: 400 !important;
        font-size: 16px;
    }
    ```

5. Restart Required

    Remember, any modifications necessitate a Thunderbird restart for changes
    to take effect.

## Add CalDAV Calendars via Ansible

For many users, Thunderbird's graphical interface is the go-to method for
adding calendars. While efficient, this method doesn't lend itself to
replicating configurations across multiple machines, especially if you need
consistency in test environments. The solution? Automate this process using
Ansible.

However, using Ansible (or any other configuration management tool) for
Thunderbird introduces a challenge: Thunderbird uses a hashed location to store
its configuration. For instance, the main configuration resides in
`~/.thunderbird`. Within this directory, the file `profiles.ini` contains a
section `Profile0` with a `Path` key pointing to the real configuration. For
clarification:

```ini
...
[Install7DFCE75BB80C198C]
Default=oGao5Tha.default-default
Locked=1

[Profile0]
Name=default-default
IsRelative=1
Path=oGao5Tha.default-default
...
```

On Debian, the `Profile1` profile is recognized as the `default` profile. But
it's the `default-default` profile that retains all the configuration.

To determine the current configuration path, you can use the script
`ansible-thunderbird-cfg-path-get`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash
export DIR=/home/USER/.thunderbird
cat $DIR/p*.ini|grep 'Pa.*-default'|sed -e "s%Path=%$DIR/%"
```

When executed, the output might resemble:

```
/home/USER/.thunderbird/oGao5Tha.default-default
```

### How the Ansible Playbook Works

The provided Ansible playbook performs the following functions:

1. **Installation**: It ensures Thunderbird is installed and up-to-date.
2. **Configuration Retrieval**: It fetches the current Thunderbird
   configuration path.
3. **Calendar Configuration**: It creates individual JavaScript files for each
   CalDAV calendar from a predefined template.
4. **File Assembly**: It compiles these individual files into a consolidated
   `user.js` configuration file.

For this playbook to function correctly:

- Ensure you have the correct ID, in this case 'id3' from `prefs.js`.
- Modify the `USER` placeholder with the appropriate user name.
- Adjust the `ansible_cfg_path` to the location where your playbooks,
  templates, and scripts are stored. The key directories are: `bin` (scripts),
  `pb` (playbooks), and `tpl` (templates).
- Use this playbook cautiously if you already possess a `user.js` as it might
  overwrite your existing configurations.

Below is the enhanced playbook:

```yaml
hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    ns: thunderbird
    ansible_cfg_path: /srv/ansible
    packages:
      - thunderbird
    caldav_calendars:
      - uuid: work
        color: "#1c71d8"
        refresh: 5
        name: Work
        uri: https://example.org/rad/USER/work
        username: USER
        imip:
          identity: id3
  tasks:
    - name: "{{ ns }}: Install and update Thunderbird"
      package:
        name: "{{ packages }}"
        state: latest
    - name: "{{ ns }}: Create a temporary directory for calendar files"
      tempfile:
        state: directory
      register: tempdir
    - name: "{{ ns }}: Retrieve the Thunderbird configuration path"
      command: "{{ ansible_cfg_path }}/bin/ansible-thunderbird-cfg-path-get"
      register: config_path_result
      changed_when: False
    - name: "{{ ns }}: Display the configuration path (optional)"
      debug:
        var: config_path_result.stdout
    - name: "{{ ns }}: Generate calendar configuration files"
      template:
        src: "{{ ansible_cfg_path }}/tpl/HOME/thunderbird/user.js"
        dest: "{{ tempdir.path }}/caldav_calendar_{{ calendar.uuid }}.js"
        mode: 'a'
      loop: "{{ caldav_calendars }}"
      loop_control:
        loop_var: calendar
      when: config_path_result.stdout is defined and config_path_result.stdout != ''
    - name: "{{ ns }}: Combine individual files into user.js"
      assemble:
        src: "{{ tempdir.path }}/"
        dest: "{{ config_path_result.stdout }}/user.js"
      when: config_path_result.stdout is defined and config_path_result.stdout != ''
```

By following this playbook, you can seamlessly integrate multiple CalDAV
calendars into Thunderbird across various machines for one user.
