description:
    The use and criticism of Curlftpfs in conjunction with rsync, which makes
    FTP servers partially accessible.

---

## Abstract

The [curlftpfs] utility can be used to "_mount_" the directory of an FTP server.
Together with other tools like [rsync] you can get a fine-grained and easy
access via the command line with the possibility of scripting. This document
describes installtion, use, and critique this approach.

## Introduction

Dealing with FTP servers can be tedious with the `ftp` command. Partially
improved are tools like `ncftp`, [lftp] or `sftp`. Some FTP servers offer
__rsync-module__ support, and [rsync] can be used to partially download an FTP
site. However, the local admin would have to know in advance that a certain
part of the FTP server is of special interest and predefine a __rsync-module__.
Usually this is not the case for exactly the part you want to download.

In this cases [curlftpfs] can be used.

| Debian | Code       | Version    |
|--------|------------|------------|
|  9     | Stretch    | 0.9.2-9+b1 |
| 10     | Buster     | 0.9.2-9+b1 |
| 11     | Bullseye   | 0.9.2-9+b1 |

## Prerequisites

1. To avoid using [curlftpfs], you should check if the part of the FTP server is
   already available via a __rsync-module__.

2. Partly root rights are needed

## Installation

Installation is straightforward and there are no special requirements or
dependencies.

```bash
aptitude install curlftpfs
```

## Usage

No configuration is required. To recursively copy a portion of an FTP server,
the following steps can be used.

```bash
mkdir /tmp/mnt
curlftpfs -o allow_other ftp://myusername:mypassword@ftp.domain.tld /tmp/mnt
mkdir /tmp/dst
cd /tmp/dst
rsync -rzv --inplace --append --progress --stats --timeout=7200 /tmp/mnt/somedir .
sudo umount /tmp/mnt
```

## Critique

1. Using [curlftpfs] with [rsync] can be inefficient compared to [lftp]
   mirroring.
2. One is able to script [curlftpfs].
3. Root rights
