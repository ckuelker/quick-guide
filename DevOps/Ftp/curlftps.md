description:
    The usage and critique of Curlftps in conjunction with rsync that makes
    FTP servers partly accessible

---

## Abstract

The tool [curlftps] can be used to "_mount_" the directory of an FTP server.
Together with other tools like [rsync], one can obtain a fine grained and easy
access via the command line with the possibility of scripting. This document
describes, installation, usage and critique of this approach.

## Introduction

Dealing with FTP servers can be tedious with the `ftp` command. Partly improved
are tools like `ncftp`, [lftp] or `sftp`. Some FTP server offer
__rsync-module__ support and [rsync] can be used to partially download a FTP
side. However the local admin would need to know in advance that a certain
part of the FTP server is of special interest and pre-define a
__rsync-module__. Usually this is not the case for exactly the part one wishes
to download.

In this cases [curlftps] can be used.

## Prerequisites

1. To avoid using [curlftps] one should check if the part of the FTP server is
   already available via a __rsync-module__
2. Partly root rights are needed

## Installation

The installation is straight forward and special prerequisites or dependencies
are not needed.

```bash
aptitude install curlftps
```

## Usage

A configuration is not needed. To recursively copy a part of an FTP server
the following steps can be used.

```bash
mkdir /tmp/mnt
curlftps -o allow_other ftp://myusername:mypassword@ftp.domain.tld /tmp/mnt
mkdir /tmp/dst
cd /tmp/dst
rsync -rzv --inplace --append --progress --stats --timeout=7200 /tmp/mnt/somedir .
sudo umount /tmp/mnt
```

## Critique

1. [curlftps] used together with [rsync] can be inefficient compared to [lftp]
   mirror
2. One is able to script [curlftps].
3. Root rights
