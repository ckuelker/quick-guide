description: Interaction with the Board Management Controller

---

The command line tool `ipmitool` is used to interact with a Board Management
Controller (BMC) via the **Intelligent Platform Management Interface** (IPMI).
IPMI is an open standard for monitoring, logging and control of hardware that
is implemented independent of the main CPU, BIOS, and OS via a side band
access. On some platforms IPMI can also be used to manage hardware inventory
information.

* SDR - Sensor Data Repository
* SEL - System Event Log
* FRU - Field Replaceable Unit

## Install

```shell
aptitude install ipmitool
```

When using, make sure some kernel modules are loaded.

```
ipmi_devintf
ipmi_msghandler
ipmi_poweroff
ipmi_si
ipmi_watchdog
```

## Set DHCP

```shell
ipmitool lan set 1 ipsrc dhcp
```

## Reset the BMC

```shell
ipmitool mc reset cold
```

Or

```shell
ipmitool mc reset warm
```

## BMC Sensor List

If the BMC supports it (that depends on the OEM) sensors can be listed. Some
sensors might be on the BMC SOC, but most likely this sensors are made
available to the BMC by various methods.  Usually the OEM defines if the value
is in or out of specification. Some values are depending on the CPU OEM.

```shell
ipmitool -I open sdr list
ACPI State       | 0x01              | ok
LPC Reset        | 0x01              | ok
Chassis          | 0x01              | ok
BMC RST          | 0x00              | ok
CPU0PECI         | 42 degrees C      | ok
CPU1PECI         | 38 degrees C      | ok
+1.1V            | 1.11 Volts        | ok
+1.4V            | 1.41 Volts        | ok
+0.9V            | 0.91 Volts        | ok
+3.0V            | 2.98 Volts        | ok
+1.5V            | 1.51 Volts        | ok
+2.5V            | 2.42 Volts        | ok
CPU0VCCP         | 0.97 Volts        | ok
CPU1VCCP         | 0.96 Volts        | ok
DDRCPU0          | 0.75 Volts        | ok
DDRCPU1          | 0.74 Volts        | ok
+1.8VICH         | 1.79 Volts        | ok
+1.5VICH         | 1.55 Volts        | ok
```

## Set The NAC Address

Setting the MAC address if the BMC can be done via the OS.

```shell
ipmitool lan set <channel> macaddr <macaddr>
```

Sometimes the MAC address can only be set by Vendor specific raw commands.
Sometimes the BMC has 2 LAN interfaces. The number depends on the hardware and
BMC firmware. The channel number needs usually to be specified.

```shell
ipmitool raw 0x0c 0x01 0x01 0xc2 0x00
ipmitool lan set 1 macaddr aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
ipmitool lan print 1

ipmitool raw 0x0c 0x01 0x08 0xc2 0x01
ipmitool lan set 8 macaddr a0:42:3f:2c:61:a2
ipmitool lan print 8
```

## Activate SOL

To activate the **Serial Console Over LAN** (SOL). If the OEM configured the
BMC in a secure way, a **user** and **password** is needed. However, since this
is usually not changed, it can be a security problem.

```shell
ipmitool -I lanplus -H $REMOTEHOST -U $USER -P $PASSWORD sol activate
ipmitool -I lanplus -H $REMOTEHOST -U $USER -P $PASSWORD -v sol info
```

## Debug SOL

To debug the setup of **Serial Over Lan** (SOL) add the `-v` option to enable
verbose output and in some case set the privilege level explicit with the `-L`
option.

```shell
    ipmitool -v -L USER -I lanplus -H 172.20.50.102 -U admin -P admin sol activate
```

If his does not help use `namp`. See [ipmitool Fails with Authentication
Issues](http://h20564.www2.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-c03481170)


## Raw Commands

Sometimes the OEM implements undocumented features into the BMC firmware that
can be reach via the **raw** option. As this commands are not standard it
depends on the BMC what the out come will be. This is just an example.

```shell
ipmitool raw 0x36 0xc
```

## Testing

Some OEMs implement meaningful self tests. However dummy self tests that
always passes have been seen in the wild.

```shell
ipmitool mc selftest
Selftest: passed
```
