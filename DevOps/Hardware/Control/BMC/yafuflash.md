## Writing The BMC Firmware

The **Board Management Controller** (`BMC`) firmware can be written from the
running `OS`. A tool for this is called **Yet Another Firmware Upgrade Flash**
(`YAFUFlash`), which is available for Linux or other proprietary `OS`.
YAFUFlash is copyrighted by American Megatrends Inc (`AMI`). Usually the `BMC`
firmware is developed by the `OEM` (with the help of external companies) or
solely by an external company. Often `BIOS` developers and vendors also offer
`BMC` firmware services, as the `BMC` needs to access `BIOS` information. For
this reason, the `BIOS` vendor is often also the `BMC` firmware vendor on a
given platform, and usually one should use the proprietary tools for flashing
the `BMC`. The following example uses `YAFUFlash` from `AMI`.

```bash
./Yafuflash -cd -info bmc_fw_v0.1.0.ima
./Yafuflash -cd bmc_fw_v0.1.0.ima
```
