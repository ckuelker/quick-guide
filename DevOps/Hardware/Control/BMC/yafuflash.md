## Writing The BMC Firmware

The **Board Management Controller** (`BMC`) firmware can be written via the
running `OS`. One tool for this is called **Yet Another Firmware Upgrade
Flash** (`YAFUFlash`) available for Linux or an other proprietary `OS`.
`YAFUFlash` is copyrighted by American Megatrends Inc (`AMI`). Usually the
`BMC` firmware is developed by the `OEM` (with the help of external companies)
or solely by an external company. Often `BIOS` developers and vendors also
offer `BMC` firmware services as the `BMC` needs to access `BIOS` information.
Therefor often the `BIOS` vendor is also the `BMC` firmware vendor on a given
platform and usually one should use the proprietary tools for flashing the
`BMC`. The following example uses `YAFUFlash` from `AMI`.

```bash
./Yafuflash -cd -info bmc_fw_v0.1.0.ima
./Yafuflash -cd  bmc_fw_v0.1.0.ima
```
