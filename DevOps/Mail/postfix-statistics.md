## Pflogsumm

When searching for "postfix mail statistic" the first 10 results are referring
to a Perl script that analyses the Postfix log files. `pflogsumm.pl` is a
script written by James S. Seymour and copyrighted 1998-2004 under the `GPL
v2+` license and lives on <https://jimsun.linxnet.com/postfix_contrib.html> as
of this writing (2022-05-04).

The `pflogsumm` script aims to provide an overview of past mail server 
activities, offering administrators a 'heads-up' in case of troubles.

### Installation

```bash
aptitude install pflogsumm
```

### Configuration

While some contributions, for example by
[Falko Timme](https://www.howtoforge.com/postfix-monitoring-with-mailgraph-and-pflogsumm-on-debian-lenny),
are suggesting to configure `logrotate` to have a dedicated log over 24 hours,
I got the impression that `pflogsumm` can do this already by itself via a time
stamp query and keywords like `yesterday`. I agree that when using the 
yesterday feature, the results depend on the time at which the cron job is 
executed. Additionally, re-invoking the same job after 24 hours would yield 
different results. So a recreation of the reports would be more difficult. 
However usually as a 'heads-up' using the `yesterday` scope as a one time shot
cron job seems justified.

### Invocations

As `pflogsumm` has a lot of command line options it might be advisable to
create a script to execute it.

For a daily (yesterday) summary to be executed after 24:00 every day (0:10):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
/usr/sbin/pflogsumm -d yesterday --iso-date-time /var/log/mail.log 2>&1 |\
/usr/bin/mailx -s "`hostname --fqdn` daily mail statistic" postmaster
```

Then add a line to cron:

```cron
10 0 * * * /usr/local/sbin/postfix-statistics-pdflogsumm-yesterday
```

For a weekly summary, for Debian 10 and 11 `logrotate` is configured for some
`locale` to start the week on Sunday 00:00.  So you would need to execute the
script 10 before the end of the week on the current log file or 10 minutes
after the week started on the last log file. We use the latter to be executed
after 24:00 on every Sunday (4:10):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
/usr/sbin/pflogsumm --iso-date-time /var/log/mail.log.1 2>&1 |\
/usr/bin/mailx -s "`hostname --fqdn` weekly mail statistic" postmaster
```

Then add a line to cron

```cron
10 4 * * 0 /usr/local/sbin/postfix-statistics-pdflogsumm-week
```

## Poststats

Unlike the name the `poststats` tool (GPLv3), despite the name is postfix
monitor with a web interface and mail sending capability triggered via cron.
As it does not provide statistics, poststats will not be covered in this 
document.
