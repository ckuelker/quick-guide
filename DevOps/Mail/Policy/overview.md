description: Overview of mail server policy daemons with the focus on Postfix

---

This overview is not complete. It started on 2023-01-13 as a summary document
for Postfix policy daemons to understand the current state of policy daemons,
as some of the well-known policy daemons mentioned in the literature are no
longer maintained.

[SMTPD_POLICY_README]: https://www.postfix.org/SMTPD_POLICY_README.html
[POSTSCREEN_README]: https://www.postfix.org/POSTSCREEN_README.html
[Greylisting]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylisting_(email)

The Postfix mail server can internally block or accept mail in a number of
ways. In cases where this is not sufficient, a Postfix `smtpd` policy (see
[SMTPD_POLICY_README][]) can be used to add functionality to Postfix. An
example of this is Postfix [greylisting][].

The Policy Weight Daemon is a well-known policy daemon for Postfix. It is also
mentioned in the German "Das Postfix Buch" and the [Policy Weight Debian
popularity][] was high between 2010 and 2016. From the [Policy Weight
unofficial source code][] repository it can be understood that development was
probably stopped around 2013 (2018-5) or earlier and the last stable version
and to-do list is from 2009. The location of the [Policy Weight source code][]
repository is unknown as of 2023-01-13. The [Policy Weight home][] declares
itself as "Project discontinued".

As of the [Policy Weight Debian package][] page, there are some known Debian
package management tasks (bugs), but no major software bugs as of 2023-01-13.
However, without an upstream bug tracker, this is difficult to know. From the
[Policy Weight to do list][] `todo.txt` of the [Policy Weight unofficial source
code][] it is clear that some important `IPv6` features are missing.

The [Policy Weight old mailing list archive][] is available until 2010. The
[Policy Weight new mailing list][] location contains the [Policy Weight new
mailing list archive][] up to 2016.

### Function

The policy weight daemon is used by Postfix `smtpd` before accepting the mail
body `DATA`. Several checks are performed by the daemon, using caching to
minimize queries. Individual checks are weighted (hence the name) with a score
(which can be changed by the administrator), which is aggregated. If the sum is
above a definable threshold, the mail is rejected before `DATA` is fetched,
saving bandwidth.

### Features

- `DNSBL`
- `RHSBL`
- `MX` (checks of `DNS` `MX` records)
- `A` `DNS` (checks of `DNS` `A` records)
- `HELO` _smtp_

### Discussion

The main advantages of policy daemons are: rejecting mail before delivery and
saving bandwidth. This is in contrast to SpamAssassin, Amavis and others that
operate after the mail `DATA` has been fetched. Policy Weight does not add
delays like _greylisting_ would. It performs rejection of fake `HELO` or sender
information with better accuracy and fewer false positives than Sender Policy
Framework (SPF).

Some of the functionality may be covered by newer versions of Postfix, version
2.8 and above. For example, the [POSTSCREEN_README][] gives information about
testing `MX` (`MX` policy test) and other DNS information. While policy weight
works __after__ `smtpd`,
[`postscreen`](https://www.postfix.org/postscreen.8.html) works __before__
`smtpd`, which can save even more bandwidth.

## postgrey

[postgrey publicity]: https://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=postgrey

[Postgrey][] is a Postfix policy server that provides greylisting.  When a
delivery request of an email is received by Postfix via `SMTP' (`smtpd'), three
data points, the _client IP_, the _sender_, and the _recipient_, are collected
and stored if this is the first time these data points have been seen. An email
is rejected if it is seen for the first time according to these three data
points, or if the time elapsed since the first encounter is less than 5 minutes
(or another configurable value). The rejection is reported to the sender in the
form of a temporary error. Most valid senders will resend later, as required by
`RFC`. Many `SPAM` hosts will not do this, as tracking the send status of mails
is usually not worth the resources, as these mailers send millions of mails.

### Discussion

Greylisting is an effective way to reduce SPAM. Around 2010 to 2017, most
non-SPAM hosts that encountered a greylisting host behaved according to the
`RFC` and very rarely email was not delivered. However, since 2017 there is a
trend where more and more companies are moving dedicated mail servers to
centralized cloud services that do not handle greylisting well. This can be
seen when a new account is set up and the email address needs to be verified.
These cloud-based verification emails are often not resent, resulting in an
inability to log in unless the cloud provider's DNS is accepted. If the mail
server has only one user, the user can temporarily disable greylisting when
signing up for a new service. If the mail server has many users, it is not
possible to accept-list or disable greylisting.  Once an email address
validation email is sent, it is too late to turn off greylisting because that
attempt will not be successful.
