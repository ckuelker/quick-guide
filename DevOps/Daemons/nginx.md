description: Some basic things on Nginx

---

[Nginx] is pronounced ``engine x``. It is a light weight http and proxy server.
"Why I should use a different web server then [Apache2]?" you might ask.
[Nginx] has some advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of [Nginx] it is
very fast for simple configured web pages, especially for only one domain.
However large installation with complex processing, one can almost say middle
ware, [Apache2] is the choice.

## Installation

Under Debian Wheezy, Jessie, Stretch and Buster (and probably others):

```shell
# aptitude install nginx
```

[Nginx] is already serving pages. More precisely one page. A welcome page. Look
at

```
    http://127.0.0.1/
```

## Configuration

The configuration under Debian is similar to [Apache2] in regard to the file
location. First you crate a file under ``/etc/nginx/sites-available`` and
then you make a link to ``/etc/nginx/sites-anabled``.

### Configuration Space

```
    .
    |-- conf.d
    |-- fastcgi.conf
    |-- fastcgi_params
    |-- koi-utf
    |-- koi-win
    |-- mime.types
    |-- nginx.conf
    |-- proxy_params
    |-- scgi_params
    |-- sites-available
    |   `-- default
    |-- sites-enabled
    |   `-- default -> /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
    |-- snippets
    |   |-- fastcgi-php.conf
    |   `-- snakeoil.conf
    |-- uwsgi_params
    `-- win-utf
```

You might edit the default site, which is already enabled. Or you just copy
content to ``/var/www/html``. Of course you have to overwrite index.html to see
your content, since this page will be delivered first. An alternative might be
to create a directory ``/var/www/html/dragon`` to serve your favorite pictures
of dragons (or what ever).

In the latter case look at:

```
    http://127.0.0.1/dragon/
```

### How To Add A Server Block

When using `nginx` a server block is similar to a virtual host under [Apache2].

[Nginx] on Debian 9 has one server block enabled by default that is configured
to serve documents out of a directory at `/var/www/html`. While this works well
for a single site, it can become difficult if multiple sites are hosted.  The
domain in this is example is called `D1`, however you should imagine something
like `example.com`.


```shell
# mkdir -p /opt/www/domain/D1/html
# vim /opt/www/domain/D1/html/index.html
# vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/exmaple.com
```

```nginx
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        root /opt/www/domain/D1/html;
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name D1;

        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}
```

```shell
# ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/D1 \
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/D1
# nginx -t
# systemctl restart nginx
```

After `certbot` run was successful this is converted to:

```nginx
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        root /opt/www/domain/D1/html;
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name D1;

        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }

  listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot
  listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/D1/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/D1/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
  include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}
```

## How To Add One More Site With Different Port?

Copy the following into the file ``/etc/nginx/sites-available/wizzards``

```nginx
server {
        listen 8080 default_server;
        listen [::]:8080 default_server;

        root /var/www/wizzards;
        index index.html;
        server_name _;
        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}
```

Then make a link and restart [Nginx]

```shell
# cd /etc/nginx/sites-eanabled
# ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/wizards .
# service nginx restart
```

Of course you have to create the directory:

```shell
# mkdir /var/www/wizards
```

And copy HTML content into it. Not wizards.

Now look at:

```
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

### How To Disable TLSv1.0 TLSv1.1

When looking at

https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=www.DOMAIN.de

It seems that TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 are better to be disabled.

Check with:

```shell
# nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 81.169.254.165|grep TLSv
|   TLSv1.0:
|   TLSv1.1:
|   TLSv1.2:
```

Change

```shell
# vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

```
        #ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2; # Dropping SSLv3, ref: POODLE
        ssl_protocols TLSv1.2; # Dropping SSLv3, ref: POODLE
```

Restart [Nginx]

Check again with:

```shell
# nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 81.169.254.165|grep TLSv
|   TLSv1.2:
```

__HOWEVER__ if you use `certbot` than it will use its own TLS configuration:

`/etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf`

There seems no way to specify with `certbot` what TLS version to allow.

## How To Deliver Pages as Reverse Proxy

This seems more common this day to build some kind of web application that
delivers parts of the content over a certain port.

```nginx
     location /auth/ {
           proxy_buffers 16 4k;
           proxy_buffer_size 2k;
           proxy_bind 127.0.0.1;
           proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4000/auth/
     }
```

## How to Serve A Language Dependent Index Page

For some users this is convenient. Other user who are not using their own
browser or who do not understand how to switch the language of their browser
are basically screwed with this setup. But non the less here it is how it is
done. (That was the long way to say: don't do it)

```nginx
server {
       listen 127.0.0.1:80 default_server;

       server_name localhost;

       root /var/www/html;
       index index.html;

       set $first_language $http_accept_language;
       if ($http_accept_language ~* '^(.+?),') {
           set $first_language $1;
       }

       set $language 'en';
       if ($first_language ~* 'de') {
           set $language 'de';
       }

       location / {
              try_files $uri/index.$language.html $uri $uri/ =404;
       }
}

```

## Serving Multiple Domains With One Server Directive

The section title could also be called 'How to serve multiple virtual domains
with [Certbot] and [Nginx]'. Usually it is very easy to serve virtual domains
with **nginx**. Either add a file with a 'server' block or add a new 'server'
block to the file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`. However in the case a
part of this file (default) is managed by [Certbot] it is easier to manage all
domains with a single 'server' block, as other parts are managed by [Certbot].
This is how a default configuration looks like. Comments are removed,
indentation changed from tab to two spaces and `$host` names (domains, like
`example.com`) have been replaced by all caps: `D1` and `D2`.

```nginx
server {
  listen 80 default_server;
  listen [::]:80 default_server;

  root /var/www/html;

  index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

  server_name _;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
  }

}

server {

  root /var/www/html;

  index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
    server_name www.D1 D1 www.D2; # managed by Certbot

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
  }

  listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot
  listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/D1/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/D1/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
  include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}
server {
    if ($host = www.D1) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

    if ($host = D1) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

    if ($host = www.D2) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

  listen 80 ;
  listen [::]:80 ;
    server_name www.D1 D1 www.D2;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot
}
```

This solution is rather simple. Add a line with the `$host` variable to the
`https` location, like so: `root /opt/www/domain/$host;` (and you may or may
not remove the other `root` statement.

```nginx
server {
  listen 80 default_server;
  listen [::]:80 default_server;

  root /var/www/html;

  index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

  server_name _;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
  }

}

server {

  index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
    server_name www.D1 D1 www.D2; # managed by Certbot

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    root /opt/wwww/domain/$host;
  }

  listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot
  listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/D1/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/D1/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
  include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}
server {
    if ($host = www.D1) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

    if ($host = D1) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

    if ($host = www.D2) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

  listen 80 ;
  listen [::]:80 ;
    server_name www.D1 D1 www.D2;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot
}

```

## Serving A Static HTML Mirror

To mirror static HTML files in an ideal world [Nginx] would work out of the box.
However sometime the pages to served might come from a non static page. In this
case it can occur that the mirroring script (for example `wget`) had written
some files with a '?'. Lets assume

```
https://example.com/Page             - dynamic html page
https://example.com/Page?action=raw  - raw Markdown content
```

When writing down the static content this might lead to files like this:

```
mirror.com/example.com/Page/index.html   - a static HTML page
mirror.com/example.com/Page?action=raw   - a static conten file
```

With the usual configuration [Nginx] would give a `404 Not Found` result, when
trying to get the URL `http://mirror.com/example.com/Page?action=raw`.  With a
changed try setup `$uri?$args` [Nginx] can server this page at least to let the
client have a download option, as this will be `application/octet-stream`.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name localhost;
    root /opt/mirror.com/example.com;
    index index.html;
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ $uri?$args =404;
    }
}
```
