description: Some basic things on Nginx

---

[Nginx] is pronounced `engine x`. It is a lightweight http and proxy server.
"Why should I use a web server other than [Apache2]?" you may ask. Nginx has
several advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of Nginx is that it is very
fast for simple configured web pages, especially for only one domain.  However,
for large installations with complex processing, one can almost say middleware,
Apache2 is the choice.

## Installation

Under Debian Wheezy, Jessie, Stretch and Buster (and probably others):

```bash
aptitude install nginx
```

[Nginx] is already serving pages. One page, to be exact. A welcome page. Look
at the URL:

```
    http://127.0.0.1/
```

## Configuration

The configuration under Debian is similar to [Apache2] in terms of file
location. First you create a file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available` and then you
make a link to `/etc/nginx/sites-anabled`.

```
    .
    |-- conf.d
    |-- fastcgi.conf
    |-- fastcgi_params
    |-- koi-utf
    |-- koi-win
    |-- mime.types
    |-- nginx.conf
    |-- proxy_params
    |-- scgi_params
    |-- sites-available
    |   `-- default
    |-- sites-enabled
    |   `-- default -> /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
    |-- snippets
    |   |-- fastcgi-php.conf
    |   `-- snakeoil.conf
    |-- uwsgi_params
    `-- win-utf
```

You can edit the default site, which is already enabled. Or you can just copy
the content to `/var/www/html`. Of course, you will have to overwrite
`index.html` to see your content, since that page is served first. An
alternative would be to create a directory `/var/www/html/dragon` to serve your
favorite pictures of dragons (or whatever).

In the latter case look at:

```
    http://127.0.0.1/dragon/
```

### Server Block

When using `nginx`, a server block is similar to a virtual host under
[Apache2].

[Nginx] on Debian 9 has a server block enabled by default, configured to serve
documents from a directory in `/var/www/html`. While this works well for a
single site, it can become difficult when hosting multiple sites.  The domain
in this example is called `D1`, but you should think of it as something like
`example.com`.


```bash
mkdir -p /opt/www/domain/D1/html
vim /opt/www/domain/D1/html/index.html
vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/exmaple.com
```

```nginx
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        root /opt/www/domain/D1/html;
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name D1;

        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}
```

```bash
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/D1 \
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/D1
nginx -t
systemctl restart nginx
```

After `certbot` run was successful this is converted to:

```nginx
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        root /opt/www/domain/D1/html;
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name D1;

        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }

  listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot
  listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/D1/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/D1/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
  include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}
```

## Add +1 Site With Different Port?

Copy the following into the file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/wizzards`

```nginx
server {
        listen 8080 default_server;
        listen [::]:8080 default_server;

        root /var/www/wizzards;
        index index.html;
        server_name _;
        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}
```

Then make a link and restart [Nginx]

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/sites-eanabled
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/wizards .
service nginx restart
```

Of course you have to create the directory:

```bash
mkdir /var/www/wizards
```

And copy HTML content into it. Not wizards.

Now look at:

```
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

### Disable TLSv1.0 TLSv1.1

When looking at

https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=www.DOMAIN.de

It seems that `TLSv1.0` and `TLSv1.1` are better to be disabled.

Check with:

```bash
nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 81.169.254.165|grep TLSv
|   TLSv1.0:
|   TLSv1.1:
|   TLSv1.2:
```

Change

```bash
 vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

```
        #ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2; # Dropping SSLv3, ref: POODLE
        ssl_protocols TLSv1.2; # Dropping SSLv3, ref: POODLE
```

Restart [Nginx]

Check again with:

```bash
nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 81.169.254.165|grep TLSv
|   TLSv1.2:
```

__HOWEVER__ if you use `certbot` then it will use its own TLS configuration:
`/etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf` There seems to be no way to specify
which TLS version to allow with `certbot`.

## Reverse Proxy

This seems to be more common these days to build some kind of web application
that delivers parts of the content over a specific port.

```nginx
     location /auth/ {
           proxy_buffers 16 4k;
           proxy_buffer_size 2k;
           proxy_bind 127.0.0.1;
           proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4000/auth/
     }
```

## I18n Index Page

This is convenient for some users. Other users who do not use their own browser
or do not understand how to change the language of their browser are basically
screwed with this setup. But nonetheless, this is how it is done. (That was the
long way of saying: don't do it)

```nginx
server {
       listen 127.0.0.1:80 default_server;

       server_name localhost;

       root /var/www/html;
       index index.html;

       set $first_language $http_accept_language;
       if ($http_accept_language ~* '^(.+?),') {
           set $first_language $1;
       }

       set $language 'en';
       if ($first_language ~* 'de') {
           set $language 'de';
       }

       location / {
              try_files $uri/index.$language.html $uri $uri/ =404;
       }
}

```

## Multiple Domains With One Server Directive

The section title could also be "How to serve multiple virtual domains with
[Certbot] and [Nginx]". Usually it is very easy to serve virtual domains with
nginx. Either add a file with a "server" block or add a new "server" block
to the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` file. However, in case a part of
this file (default) is managed by Certbot, it is easier to manage all domains
with a single 'server' block, as other parts are managed by Certbot.  This is
what a default configuration looks like. Comments are removed, indentation is
changed from tab to two spaces and `$host` names (domains like `example.com`)
are replaced by all caps: `D1` and `D2`.

```nginx
server {
  listen 80 default_server;
  listen [::]:80 default_server;

  root /var/www/html;

  index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

  server_name _;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
  }

}

server {

  root /var/www/html;

  index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
    server_name www.D1 D1 www.D2; # managed by Certbot

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
  }

  listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot
  listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/D1/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/D1/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
  include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}
server {
    if ($host = www.D1) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

    if ($host = D1) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

    if ($host = www.D2) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

  listen 80 ;
  listen [::]:80 ;
    server_name www.D1 D1 www.D2;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot
}
```

The solution is quite simple. Add a line with the `$host` variable to the
`https` location, like this `root /opt/www/domain/$host;` (and you may or may
not remove the other `root` directive.

```nginx
server {
  listen 80 default_server;
  listen [::]:80 default_server;

  root /var/www/html;

  index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

  server_name _;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
  }

}

server {

  index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
    server_name www.D1 D1 www.D2; # managed by Certbot

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    root /opt/wwww/domain/$host;
  }

  listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot
  listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/D1/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/D1/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
  include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}
server {
    if ($host = www.D1) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

    if ($host = D1) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

    if ($host = www.D2) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

  listen 80 ;
  listen [::]:80 ;
    server_name www.D1 D1 www.D2;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot
}

```

## Static HTML Mirror

To mirror static HTML files, in an ideal world [Nginx] would work out of the
box. However, sometimes the pages to be served may come from a non-static
page. In this case, the mirroring script (e.g. `wget`) may have written some
files with a '? For example

```
https://example.com/Page             - dynamic html page
https://example.com/Page?action=raw  - raw Markdown content
```

When writing down the static content this might lead to files like this:

```
mirror.com/example.com/Page/index.html   - a static HTML page
mirror.com/example.com/Page?action=raw   - a static conten file
```

With the usual configuration, [Nginx] would return a `404 Not Found` result
when trying to get the URL `http://mirror.com/example.com/Page?action=raw`.
With a modified try setup `$uri?$args` Nginx can at least serve this page to
give the client a download option as this will be `application/octet-stream`.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name localhost;
    root /opt/mirror.com/example.com;
    index index.html;
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ $uri?$args =404;
    }
}
```
