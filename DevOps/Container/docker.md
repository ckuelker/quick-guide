## Introduction

Docker is an open source software mechanism for building, shipping, and running
applications. Docker allows you to separate your software applications from
your software infrastructure through an abstraction layer so you can deploy
software in a generalized way. With Docker, you can manage your servers the
same way you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methods
for rapidly shipping, testing, and deploying code, Docker promises to
significantly reduce the time between writing code and running it on a server
in a production environment.

Docker Engine can be installed in different ways:

- Setup own Docker repository and install from them for the ease of
  installation and upgrade tasks. This is the recommended approach, except for
  Raspbian.
- Download DEB packages and install them manually and manage upgrades
  completely manually.
  This gives full control on systems not connected to the internet.
- In testing and development environments scripts can install Docker in one
  shot. This is currently the most used approach for Raspbian.

=> <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/>

Membership in the docker group is more dangerous than `sudo`, according to the
[Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/Docker). This is due to the `setUID` root
of the docker daemon and easy access to root. Access to docker commands
therefore effectively grants root access. Therefore, do not add users to the
docker group and use docker only with `sudo`.

## Editions

Docker comes in editions.

- ce: community edition
  - edge: monthly release
  - stable: quarterly release
- ee: enterprise edition
  - quarterly release

## Debian 11 on ARM

The `docker.io` package contains the daemon and client. From the package
description:

> "Using docker.io on non-amd64 hosts is not supported at this time. Please be
> careful when using it on anything besides amd64."

## Docker Repository

Docker is used through what is called a _Docker repository_. That is, you
create a Docker repository before you install the Docker engine. After
installation, this repository can be used to update Docker. __Warning:__
Rasbian (or Debian for Arm?) users cannot use this method. Instead, they use a
so-called ["convenience
script"](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#install-using-the-convenience-script),
which can be obtained via a [link](https://get.docker.com/). This method has
not been tested.

## Docker on Raspberry Pi 4 Debian 11 Bullseye

This works for Debian on `x86_64` / `amd64`, `armhf`, `arm64`, and `Raspbian`
and is a _hello world_ example.

```bash
aptitude purge docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
aptitude install docker docker.io containerd runc
 # test docker installation
docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
93288797bd35: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:cc15c5b292d8525effc0f89cb299f1804f3a725c8d05e158653a563f15e4f685
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (arm64v8)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

As root

```bash
export U=userid
aptitude install docker.io
root@w2:~# touch /var/run/docker.sock
root@w2:~# chown $U.$U /var/run/docker.so
```

As User

```bash
docker build --tag dh-venv-builder .
[...] (some minutes later)
Successfully built fba3ab967839
Successfully tagged dh-venv-builder:latest

docker run --rm dh-venv-builder tar -C /dpkg -c . | tar -C dist -xv

./dh-virtualenv_1.2.2-1~buster_amd64.buildinfo
./dh-virtualenv_1.2.2-1~buster_amd64.changes
```

### Virtual Environment

```bash
aptitude install dh-virtualenv
```

## Simple Docker Usage

List all containers

```bash
docker container ls
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE ...
419f0ee92d82   ...
```

Enter a container

```bash
docker exec -i -t 419f0ee92d82 bash
```

Leave a container with a bash shell

```bash
exit
```
