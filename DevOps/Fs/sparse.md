__Sparse files__ are files that allocate data to disk space  and summarize
empty space (null bytes blocks) in the meta data, making the use of the file
system storage more efficiently.  When meta data space is allocated to data,
the data is written to the file system and the count of empty space is reduced.
In this manner reported file size and actual used disk space differs for sparse
files that contain empty space. The size of the file gets its maximum on the
file system when there is no empty data. Therefore sparse files makes only
sense for information that has a lot of empty data or at least a lot of empty
data in the beginning. It makes no sense to create sparse file to be filled
completely with data.

The ability to creates sparse files is dependent on the file system. A peculiar
feature of sparse files is the discrepancy with reported size (__apparent
size__) and __actual size__ of used blocks on the storage media, which makes
the use of some command not intuitive. This document shows how to create sparse
file with different tools as well as measure them.

Reading sparse file will convert transparently to the application empty meta
data to empty blocks filled with zero bytes. This is the opposite when writing.
On Linux most modern file systems support sparse files. That includes NTFS
but not `HFS+`.

A very common usage for sparse files are disk images. A disk image is a large
file containing data. Often the data is a formatted file system. Usually new
file systems are mostly empty, therefore using sparse files for this purpose
safes a large amount of real disk space until the disk image file system is
filled with non empty data. However it has to be noted that sparse files are
not a miracle. If a sparse file is created that is larger than the actual free
space of a disk, which is possible, it will grow up to the remaining empty disk
space, but not beyond. Of course planning ahead is important as running a file
system on disk or inside a sparse file that hits the boundaries of free space
is a nightmare as the kind of corruption that may occur is not predictable.

While the creation of a sparse file is very efficient, when used as disk image
a sparse file can become fragmented and less efficient. Filling up file systems
inside a sparse file can have unexpected effects. Of course some tools will not
show that a certain file is a sparse file. And when copied or moved around the
tool to do the movement or copy need to be capable of handling sparse files.
If a too is used that can not copy a sparse file, the empty data represented in
the meta data of the file system can be omitted and the result will be a
corrupted file or a file which content is not usable any more. In a minor
severe case a sparse file would be copied to a non sparse file with lot of
empty space allocated to the disk, which would revert the usefulness of using
sparse files. That might happen when using sparse file aware tool to copy a
sparse file from a sparse file aware file system to a non sparse file aware
file system.

The following file systems for Linux (according to Wikipedia [File Systems])
might support sparse files:

- BeeGFS
- APFS
- V6FS, V7FS
- GFS
- NTFS
- FFS
- UFS1, UFS 2
- LFS
- ext, ext2, ext3, ext4
- NOVA
- F2FS
- Lustre
- NILFS
- ReiserFS, Reiser4
- OCFS2
- XFS
- JFS
- VxFS
- UDF
- ZFS
- Btrfs
- ReFS
- SquashFS
- BlueStore/Cephfs

## Making

Each of the below two commands create a 128MB sparse file called `file.image`.

```bash
truncate -s 128M file.image
dd if=/dev/zero of=file.image bs=1 count=0 seek=128M
```

## Measure

### Apparent Size

```bash
du -h --apparent file.image
128M    file.image
```

### Actual Size

```bash
du -h file.image
0    file.image
```

### Apparent And Actual Size

```bash
du -h file.image;du -h --apparent file.image
0       file.image
128M    file.image
  # Shows first current size (0) and apparent size (128M)
ls -hls file.image
0 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 128M Mar 21 14:09 file.image
  # The same for a used sparse file
ls -hls file.image
4.1M -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.0G Mar 21 13:20 file.image
```

Some `du` use `--apparent-size` instead of `--apparent`.

## Converting

### To

Converting files to sparse files works only on supported file systems.

```bash
  # make a non sparse file
cp unknown.image non-sparse.image --sparse=never
du -h non-sparse.image
128M    non-sparse.image
  # convert a non sparse file to a sparse file
fallocate -d non-sparse.image
  # This step is not need, but would remind about the feature
mv non-sparse.image sparse.image
du -h sparse.image
0    sparse.image
```

### From

```bash
cp sparse.image non-sparse.image --sparse=never
```

## Copying

Usually `cp` can detect a sparse file. No option is needed. However if one want
to be explicit the `--sparse` option can be used. This can also be used convert
a non sparse file to a sparse file while copying. When using `rsync` the `-S`
or `--sparse` option need to be set.

```bash
cp old.image new.image # sparseness of files is the same
cp --sparse=always old.image new.image # old.image could be non-sparse
rsync -S old.image new.image
```

## Archiving

Per default `tar` uses non-sparse files. And `tar` converts sparse file to
non-sparse files! To use `tar` and keep the sparse feature of files use the
`-S` option.

This example used the sparse file `file.image` that contains a `XFS` file
system that uses 3.6M of meta data (that is of course not empty and therefore
not sparse).

```bash
tar -cf file.tar file.image
du -h file.tar --apparent; du -h file.tar
129M    file.tar
129M    file.tar

tar -Scf file.tar file.image
du -h file.tar --apparent; du -h file.tar
3.6M    file.tar
3.6M    file.tar
```

## Creating A File System Inside

```bash
mkfs.xfs sparse.image
```

~~~
meta-data=file.image             isize=512    agcount=4, agsize=8192 blks
         =                       sectsz=512   attr=2, projid32bit=1
         =                       crc=1        finobt=1, sparse=0, rmapbt=0, reflink=0
data     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=32768, imaxpct=25
         =                       sunit=0      swidth=0 blks
naming   =version 2              bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0 ftype=1
log      =internal log           bsize=4096   blocks=855, version=2
         =                       sectsz=512   sunit=0 blks, lazy-count=1
realtime =none                   extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0
~~~

```bash
du -h file.image --apparent; du -h file.image
```

~~~
128M    file.image
3.6M    file.image
~~~

## Enlarge

With `dd` it is possible to grow an existing sparse file. Even if it contains a
file system.

```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=file.image bs=1 count=0 seek=1G
du -h file.image --apparent; du -h file.image
1.0G    file.image
3.6M    file.image
```

## Mounting A File System

There is no difference of mounting file systems of non-sparse files and sparse
files.

```bash
mkdir mountpoint
mound -o loop file.image mountpoint
df -h|grep mountpoint
/dev/loop0               125M  6.8M  118M   6% /tmp/mountpoint
```

## Resize A File System

Resizing a file system is a delicate matter. As a matter of fact the way to
resize a file system depends on the file system and its tools. Just to see how
it is done in this section should not let you assume that it is done similar to
a different file system. Also be warned, resizing a used file system __is
risky__ and data loss may occur. Better make a validated backup before trying
to resize a partition.

While a sparse file containing `riserfs` can (and should?) be resized while it
is __not__ mounted. A `XFS` can only be resized while it __is__ mounted.

| Action             |  XFS        | ReiserFS    |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| create sparse file | not mounted | not mounted |
| make file system   | not mounted | not mounted |
| grow sparse file   | not mounted | not mounted |
| grow file system   | mounted     | not mounted |


The command to grow a file system depends on the file system. For `xfs` it is
`xfs_growfs` for `reiserfs` it is `resize_reiserfs`.

```bash
  # Create a 128 MB image
truncate -s 128M file.image
du -h file.image;du --apparent -h file.image
0       file.image
128M    file.image
```

```bash
  # Make a XFS file system
mkfs.xfs file.image
meta-data=file.image             isize=512    agcount=4, agsize=8192 blks
         =                       sectsz=512   attr=2, projid32bit=1
         =                       crc=1        finobt=1, sparse=0, rmapbt=0, reflink=0
data     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=32768, imaxpct=25
         =                       sunit=0      swidth=0 blks
naming   =version 2              bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0 ftype=1
log      =internal log           bsize=4096   blocks=855, version=2
         =                       sectsz=512   sunit=0 blks, lazy-count=1
realtime =none                   extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0
du -h file.image;du --apparent -h file.image
3.6M    file.image
128M    file.image
```

```bash
  # Enlarge the XFS file system from 128MB to 1GB
dd if=/dev/zero of=file.image bs=1 count=0 seek=1G
0+0 records in
0+0 records out
0 bytes copied, 4.7421e-05 s, 0.0 kB/s
du -h file.image;du --apparent -h file.image
3.6M    file.image
1.0G    file.image
```

```bash
  # Mount XFS file system (a mount point will be created in /tmp/SPARSE)
mkdir mnt
mount -o loop file.image mnt
df -h|grep mnt
/dev/loop0               125M  6.8M  118M   6% /tmp/SPARSE/mnt
