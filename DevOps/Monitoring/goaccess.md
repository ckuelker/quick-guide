description: Goaccess can monitor Apache, Nginx and other web server log files

---

[Goaccess] can monitor a web server's log file in real time. Either by
providing output to the console or by creating a static or real-time HTML
report.

## Features

- MIT license
- Fast, real-time, millisecond/second updates
- written in C
- Only `ncurses` as a dependency
- Many web log formats (Apache, Nginx, Amazon S3, Elastic Load Balancing,
  CloudFront, Caddy, for the latest version. A bit less for Debian Buster)
- Beautiful terminal

## Installation

```bash
aptitude install goaccess
```

## Command Line Usage

The manual page gives a lot of command line options. A simple way to use it is
the command line mode that just uses the log file as a parameter.

Preferable this should be run inside `screen` or similar to maintain running,
even if the ssh connection drops. A restart is not a problem.


```bash
cd /var/log/nginx
goaccess access.log

## Static HTML Report Usage

Crate a static HTML report in a dedicated directory `TEST`:

```
cd
mkdir TEST
cd TEST
goaccess /var/log/nginx/access.log -o report.html --log-format=COMBINED
```

This will generate the file `report.hml`. View this with you browser or
create this in a directory served by the web server.

For Debian 10 Buster this will be created with missing missing Unicode
characters under Firefox. Other browsers display them.

## Real Time HTML Report Usage

This is just a short test and has some flaws that need to be addressed.

```
goaccess /var/log/nginx/access.log -o /web/server/root/report.html \
--log-format=COMBINED --real-time-html
```

The above command will generate a page under the web server root as well opens
a socked for the update. A short test under Debian 10 Buster reveals some
problems. The main problem is that the page is not displayed with Firefox or
Chromium. Chromium complained about insecure scripts. After waving, the page
was displayed. However as permanent solution this would not be acceptable.
Firefox received the page with code 200 but failed to load the `favicon.ico`
and three `fontawesome` web fonts.
