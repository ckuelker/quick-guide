## Introduction

Tuptime is a software tool designed for reporting both historical and
statistical real-time operating data of a system, maintaining this information
across restarts. It offers a similar functionality to the 'uptime' command, but
provides a more comprehensive output. The tool summarizes both uptime and
downtime.

Tuptime operates without requiring daemon processes. It executes only during
system startup and shutdown processes initiated by the init manager. To address
unexpected shutdowns, such as power failures, the tool includes a cron job and
a timer unit that periodically update the records. System administrators can
configure the update interval based on their specific system requirements.

The tool is developed in Python, utilizing commonly used modules and aiming for
minimal dependency, rapid execution, and ease of understanding and modification
for specific use cases.

Data is stored in a SQLite database, allowing access and utilization by other
software. The database specifications are detailed in tuptime-manual.txt.
Tuptime offers the functionality to output data in various formats, including
seconds, epoch time, and CSV, facilitating integration with other commands.

Tuptime's primary function is to track system startups and shutdowns,
presenting this information in a user-friendly format. It does not include
features like email alerts for milestones or limitations on record history. The
tool is also designed to avoid incorrect logging of false startups, a common
issue in scenarios like NTP adjustments, virtualized environments, high-load
servers, or clock resynchronization after suspend and resume cycles.

## Installation

## Usage


__Example 1: Default Output__

Command to display default output:

```bash
# Without data
System startups:         1  since  01:08:12 PM 03/11/2024
System shutdowns:        0 ok  +  0 bad
System life:             21m 54s

Longest uptime:          21m 54s  from  01:08:12 PM 03/11/2024
Average uptime:          21m 54s
System uptime:           100.0%  =  21m 54s

Longest downtime:        0s
Average downtime:        0s
System downtime:         0.0%  =  0s

Current uptime:          21m 54s  since  01:08:12 PM 03/11/2024
```

This output is right after installation, so basically it shows no data.

```bash
# With one reboot
System startups:         2  since  01:08:12 PM 03/11/2024
System shutdowns:        1 ok  +  0 bad
System life:             1h 11m 42s

Longest uptime:          1h 10m 12s  from  01:08:12 PM 03/11/2024
Average uptime:          35m 36s
System uptime:           99.33%  =  1h 11m 13s

Longest downtime:        29s  from  02:18:24 PM 03/11/2024
Average downtime:        29s
System downtime:         0.67%  =  29s

Current uptime:          1m 1s  since  02:18:53 PM 03/11/2024
```


__Example 2: Tabular Output__

  1   01:08:12 PM 03/11/2024   23m 57s

# With 1 reboot
tuptime -t
  1   01:08:12 PM 03/11/2024   1h 10m 12s   02:18:24 PM 03/11/2024   OK         29s
