## VLC Streaming

The "poor man's" streaming solution is __vlc__. When you first look into what
is needed to stream a file, directory or media collection locally, you will
find a lot of tutorials suggesting to use a _stream generator_ like `ices2` or
`darkice` and connect it to a _streaming server_ like `icecast2`. While this
can be set up in maybe 15 minutes and can be very robust, it seems to have too
much complexity. The solution here is to simply use `vlc`. One command on the
server and one command on the client.

Scenario:

- Desktop aka _the server_
- Laptop A
- Laptop B

### Server

Browse to a directory that contains audio or video files, or use a file. Run
of the following commands in the directory or file.

```bash
# 1
vlc -vvv `pwd` --sout '#rtp{mux=ts,dst=239.255.12.42,sdp=sap,name="Stream"}'
# 2
vlc -vvv --sout '#rtp{mux=ts,dst=239.255.12.42,sdp=sap,name="Stream"}' .
# 3
export RTP="#rtp{mux=ts,dst=239.255.12.42,sdp=sap,name='Stream'}"
find -name "*.mp4" -print0|xargs -0 vlc --sout $RTP
```

It is also possible to stream a stream. This has the advantage that the
download bandwidth is used only once and that all clients play the stream via
the local network. This works in principle with `m3u8` and `mp3` `URL` types.

```bash
# 1
export URL=https://example.org/stream.m3u8
# 2
export URL=https://example.org/stream.mp3
vlc --sout '#rtp{mux=ts,dst=239.255.12.42,sdp=sap,name="Stream"}' $URL
```

The GUI can be used to steer the stream.

While it is possible to add a `dublicate` rule to `vlc` that would _display_
the video or play the sound on the local machine, the disadvantage of such a
solution is a delay in playback. If you use, say, the desktop in room A and the
laptop in room B, you would hear an unpleasant delay. To not hear a delay, just
run a `vlc` client on a second terminal.

```bash
vlc rtp://239.255.12.42
```

This also has the advantage of being a test to see if it works.

### Client

For each client (Laptop A, Laptop B), run a `vlc` that connects to this
multicast address.

```bash
vlc rtp://239.255.12.42
```

## Ffmpeg

### Stream the Local Audio Device

Sometimes a process plays something on the local audio device. For example, a 5
hour podcast or a live stream of a rocket launch that takes a long time.  If
you do not want to interrupt this playback, but want to change the room, it is
possible to ad hoc stream the local audio device to another computer.

#### Start a Local Ffmpg Server

```bash
ffmpeg -f pulse -i alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo.monitor \
-acodec libopus -b:a 128k -vn -f rtp rtp://239.255.12.42:5004 \
-sdp_file audio_stream.sdp
```

If your audio device is different use:

```bash
ffmpeg -f pulse -i $(pactl list short sources | grep 'monitor' | \
awk '{print $2}' | head -n1) -acodec libopus -b:a 128k -vn \
-f rtp rtp://239.255.12.42:5004 -sdp_file audio_stream.sdp
```

In another shell, copy the `audio_stream.sdp`' file to the remote client.

```bash
scp audio_stream.sdp remote.machine:
```

#### Start a Client on a Different Machine

For this to work, you need the `audio_stream.sdp` file from the server.

```bash
ffplay -protocol_whitelist file,rtp,udp -i audio_stream.sdp
```
