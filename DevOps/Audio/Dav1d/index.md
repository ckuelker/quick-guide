## Installation

To install dav1d on systems (tested under Debian 12 Bookworm) utilizing
aptitude, the following commands are recommended:

1. **Update the Package List**

   To ensure all dependencies are current, initiate an update with:

   ```bash
   aptitude update
   ```

2. **Install dav1d**

   Proceed with the installation of dav1d by executing:

   ```bash
   aptitude install dav1d
   ```

3. **Verify the Installation**

   Confirm the installation of dav1d by checking its version:

   ```bash
   dav1d --version
   1.0.0
   ```

These steps facilitate the proper installation of dav1d, preparing the system
for subsequent configuration and deployment tasks.

### Ansible

```yaml
- hosts: role_client
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes
  vars:
    ns: video_nox
    packages:
      - dav1d
      - libdav1d6
  tasks:
    - name: "{{ ns }}: Install and update packages"
      package:
        name: "{{ packages }}"
        state: latest
```

## Configuration

dav1d is primarily focused on decoding AV1 video streams efficiently, and it
does not involve extensive configuration at the user level since it's
designed to be a fast and minimalistic decoder. The primary interaction users
might have in terms of "configuration" typically involves choosing how to
integrate and utilize dav1d in various applications or projects, rather than
configuring the tool itself.

However, for the sake of thoroughness and to address situations where system
libraries or dependencies like libdav1d6 (the dav1d library package) may
involve configuration, the following section addresses this.

### Configuration of dav1d and libdav1d6

dav1d is optimized for performance and simplicity and does not require
traditional configuration files or settings adjustments post-installation.
However, system administrators may need to ensure that it is correctly
integrated with other video processing tools and applications.

1. **Library Integration**

   - Ensure that `libdav1d6` is recognized by software requiring AV1 decoding
     by verifying the linker's cache, this should not be needed under Debian.

     ```bash
     ldconfig -p | grep libdav1d
     libdav1d.so.6 (libc6,x86-64) => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdav1d.so.6
     ```

   - If the library is not listed, update the cache:
     ```bash
     sudo ldconfig
     ```

2. **Performance Tuning**

   - While dav1d itself does not offer configurable settings, performance can
     be influenced by the environment it operates within. Consider tuning
     system parameters such as CPU affinity and real-time priorities,
     especially in a multi-threaded environment, especially in multi CPU 
     environments:

     ```bash
     taskset -c [CPU cores] [mask] [command to run dav1d]
     ```

3. **Integration with Media Players**

   - Ensure media players are configured to use dav1d for AV1 decoding. This
     usually involves setting dav1d as the preferred or default decoder for AV1
     streams within the player's settings.

## Usage

The dav1d command line tool includes the `--cpumask` option, which is designed
to optimize decoding performance by restricting the usage of certain CPU
instruction sets. This can be particularly useful in systems where specific
instruction sets may lead to better decoding efficiency or in scenarios where
it's necessary to maintain compatibility with older hardware that does not
support newer instructions.

**Steps to Configure and Use `--cpumask`:**

1. **Identify Supported Instruction Sets**:

   Before configuring the mask, determine which instruction sets are supported
   by the CPU. This can be done using the `lscpu` command or by examining
   `/proc/cpuinfo`:

   ```bash
   grep flags /proc/cpuinfo | uniq
   ```

   Example output:

   ~~~
   flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca \
   cmov pat pse36 clflush mmx fxsr sse sse2 ht syscall nx mmxext fxsr_opt \

   npt lbrv svm_lock nrip_save tsc_scale vmcb_clean flushbyasid decodeassists \
   pausefilter pfthreshold
   ~~~

2. **Select the Appropriate Instruction Set**:

   Choose an instruction set that is supported by your CPU and offers the best
   performance for AV1 decoding. Common options include:

   - `0`: No specific instruction set; use the default configuration
   - `sse2`: Utilize the SSE2 instruction set
   - `ssse3`: Utilize the SSSE3 instruction set
   - `sse41`: Utilize the SSE4.1 instruction set
   - `avx2`: Utilize the AVX2 instruction set for enhanced performance on newer
     CPUs
   - `avx512`: Utilize the AVX512 instruction set for the highest performance
     on the latest CPUs.

3. **Run dav1d with the Selected CPU Mask**:

   Once the optimal instruction set is identified, run dav1d with the
   `--cpumask` option. For example, to decode using the AVX2 instruction set,
   execute:

   ```bash
   dav1d --cpumask=avx2 -i input.ivf --muxer=md5      -o output.md5      # 1
   dav1d --cpumask=avx2 -i input.ivf --muxer=yuv2mpeg -o output.yuv2mpeg # 2
   dav1d --cpumask=avx2 -i input.ivf --muxer=yuv      -o output.yuv      # 3
   ```
   
   1. MD5 checksum
   2. Video playable
   3. Raw video data

   | File             | Size  | Playable with vlc |
   | ---------------- | ----- | ----------------- |
   | source.mp4       |   16M | yes               |
   | input.ivf        |   14M | yes               |
   | output.md5       |  4.0K | no                |
   | output.yuv4mpeg2 | 268MB | yes               |
   | output.yuv       |  2.4G | no                |

   Remark: Creating the `input.ivf` from an `input.mp4` can be done like so
   and can take a wile:

   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libaom-av1 -crf 30 -b:v 0 input.ivf
   ```

   (The `input.ivf` is actually the output of the `ffmpeg` command)

   YUV files represent a category of file formats used primarily for storing
   raw video data. The YUV model separates the brightness information 
   (luminance, denoted by Y) from the color information (chrominance, denoted
   by U and V) in a video. 

   Other interesting options (of 1.4.2-8-gda2cc78) are:
 
   - `--limit N` stop decoding after N frames
   - `--skip N` skip decoding of the first N frames
   - `--threads N` number of threads (default: 0)
   - `--verify MD5` verify decoded md5, implies `--muxer md5`, no output
   - ...

## Compiling Dav1d from Source

Compiling dav1d from source allows for customization and optimization specific
to the system architecture in use. This section outlines the step-by-step
process to compile the dav1d decoder. This should work Debian >= 10 Buster.

### Prerequisites

Before starting the compilation process, ensure that the following dependencies
are installed on the system:

- `meson` >= 0.49 - a build system required to configure the build environment.
  - <https://mesonbuild.com/>
  - <https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson> 
- `ninja` - a small build system with a focus on speed.
  - <https://ninja-build.org/>
- `gcc` or `clang` - compilers that support C11.
- `git` - version control system to clone the repository.
- `nasm` (2.14 or higher) (requires Autoconf version 2.71 or higher, Debian 9 
   Stretch has 2.69-10) - General-purpose x86 assembler
- `autoconf` - General-purpose x86 assembler
Install these dependencies using the package manager that corresponds with the
system's distribution.

#### Installation

1. **Update Package Lists:** Before installing the packages, it's a good
practice to update the package lists to ensure you are downloading the latest
versions available. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   aptitude update
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages:** Install the dependencies required to compile
dav1d by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   aptitude install meson ninja-build gcc git nasm autoconf
   ```

#### Verification

After the installation is complete, you can verify that the tools are installed
correctly by checking their versions. Run the following commands:

- For Meson:
  ```bash
  meson --version
  1.0.1
  ninja --version
  1.11.1
  gcc --version
  gcc (Debian 12.2.0-14) 12.2.0
  Copyright (C) 2022 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
  warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
  git --version
  git version 2.39.2
  ```

### Cloning the Repository

First, clone the dav1d repository from its official GitLab page:

```bash
git clone https://code.videolan.org/videolan/dav1d.git
cd dav1d
```

### Configuring the Build

Use Meson to configure the build environment. A build directory should be
created to keep the build separate from the source:

```bash
# The old form
meson build --buildtype release
# The new form
meson setup build  --buildtype release
```

This command sets up the build directory with the configuration necessary for a
release build, optimizing performance. Additional flags can be added to
customize the build further.

### Building the Project

After configuring the build, use Ninja to compile dav1d. Just run your build
command (e.g. ninja) and Meson will regenerate as necessary.  If ninja fails,
run "ninja reconfigure" or "meson setup --reconfigure" to force Meson to
regenerate.

If build failures persist, run "meson setup --wipe" to rebuild from scratch
using the same options as passed when configuring the build.  To change option
values, run "meson configure" instead.

```bash
ninja -C build
```

This command compiles the code using the settings specified in the `meson`
configuration step. After compilation dav1d can be found under `build/tools`.

### Installing

Once the build is complete, install the binary to the system:

```bash
ninja -C build install
```

### Verification

To ensure the binary was compiled and installed correctly, run:

```bash
dav1d --version;build/tools/dav1d --version
1.0.0                                     # system version
1.4.2-8-gda2cc78                          # compiled version
```
