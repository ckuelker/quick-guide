    Comprehensive guide to build a custom version of Neovim

---

## Abstract

This document provides in-depth instructions for experienced Debian
administrators seeking to compile and install a customized version of Neovim, a
highly configurable text editor.

## Introduction

The task of compiling and installing software like Neovim on Debian-based
systems can be a complex undertaking when the packaged version is too old, even
for seasoned administrators. This guide aims to facilitate this process,
providing step-by-step instructions and addressing potential challenges
associated with older systems.

## Releases

### Package

- Neovim is in Debian and a fast development can be seen

| Debian   | #  | Neovim  |
| -------- | -- | --------|
| Bookworm | 12 | 0.7.2-7 |
| Bullseye | 11 | 0.4.4-1 |
| Buster   | 10 | 0.3.4-3 |

### Upstream Releases

The current __source__ stable release is neovim 0.9.0 040f145
  <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/archive/refs/tags/v0.9.0.tar.gz>

- It is possible to install via tar (nvim-linux64.tar.gz)
  <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/>
  The current 2023-05-17 stable release is:
  <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/download/v0.9.0/nvim-linux64.tar.gz>
- Also at <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases> an AppImage package is
  provided

## Build From Source

This section describe the build of Neovim from source.

### Dependencies

From the repository's root directory, running make will download and build all
the needed dependencies and put the `nvim` executable in `build/bin`. However
to be consistent the dependencies also can be installed via package manager.

```bash
aptitude install ninja-build gettext libtool libtool-bin autoconf automake \
cmake g++ pkg-config unzip curl git
```

The ninja-build is a optional build dependency. It is more a development
dependency, Neovim will build without, but will build faster with. The build
will use _ccache_ if available. To disable: `CCACHE_DISABLE=true` make.

The compilation of Neovim can present hurdles, particularly on older systems. A
key challenge is that the build process requires `cmake` version 3.10 or above,
while Debian 9 Stretch only includes version 3.7.2.

Here are the CMake versions bundled with recent stable Debian releases:

| Debian   | #  | Release     | CMake  |
| -------- | -- | ----------- | ------ |
| Stretch  |  9 | June 2017   | 3.7.2  |
| Buster   | 10 | July 2019   | 3.13.4 |
| Bullseye | 11 | August 2021 | 3.18.4 |
| Bookworm | 12 | June 2023   | 3.25.1 |

For the most accurate and up-to-date information, consider referring to the
Debian package tracking system or running apt-cache policy cmake on your Debian
system. The current version in the stable Debian 11 Bullseye as of 2023-05-16
is 3.18.4-2+deb11u1.

__Some Dependencies Of Neovim Project In Detail__

* [LuaJIT](https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT)
* [Lua](https://www.lua.org/download.html)
* [Luv](https://github.com/luvit/luv)
* [gettext](https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gettext/)
* [libiconv](https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libiconv)
* [libtermkey](https://github.com/neovim/libtermkey)
* [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv)
* [libvterm](http://www.leonerd.org.uk/code/libvterm/)
* [lua-compat](https://github.com/keplerproject/lua-compat-5.3)
* [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter)
* [unibilium](https://github.com/neovim/unibilium)

### Run Make

First, as root

```bash
mkdir -p /srv/{build,neovim}
chown $USER.$USER /srv/{build,neovim}
```

Then, as `$USER`

```bash
cd /srv/build
git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim
cd neovim
# If you want to build the last stable version from the repository
# checkout 'stable'
git checkout stable
# Use gmake on BSD instead of make
make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/srv/neovim
```

The type `RelWithDebInfo` ("Release With Debug Info") enables optimizations and
add debug information so you can get a backtrace in the case of crashing. Do
not add a -j flag if ninja is installed! The build will be in parallel
automatically.

On a 4-core CPU from 2017, this process takes less than 1.5 minutes if
dependencies need to be downloaded, and significantly less if dependencies are
already provided by the package manager. Please note that the build system may
encounter issues if run multiple times. If you encounter any issues, try
downloading the repository again and running cmake on a fresh repository
if the suggestion in the next paragraph do not work.

CMake is the main build system that caches in `build/CMakeCache.txt`. If you
want to change something, like `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` or `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`,
run `rm -rf build` first. This is also required when rebuilding Neovim after a
Git commit adds or removes files (this is including from runtime). When you are
not sure if somethings changed, run `make distclean`, that is basically a
shortcut for `rm -rf build .deps`.

## Build Package

On Debian you also have the possibility to create a package

```bash
cd /srv/build/neovim
cd build && cpack -G DEB
```

This will produce 2 files:

 - `nvim-linux64.deb`
 - `_CPack_Packages/Linux/DEB/nvim-linux64.deb`

To install as root use `dpkg -i nvim-linux64.deb`.

For faster build install: Ninja, `ccache`

### Install

```bash
cd /srv/build/neovim
make install
```

This will give a binary in `/srv/neovim/bin` called `nvim`.

## Tests

One easy test is to start neovim (`nvim`) and give the command `:checkhealth`
to understand what is missing in terms of dependencies and configuration.
