description: How to check the LICENSE file in regard to github.com

---

The website <https://github.com> usually shows the license next to a git
repository. Sometimes this information shows "other" and the license is not
known to _github.com_. This document briefly describes how _github.com_ detects
licenses and how to verify (**without guarantee**) that a project license is
detected.

## The Quick Guide

1. Choose a recent operating system, such as Debian Bullseye
2. Install the `licensee` dependencies: `aptitude install ruby-rugged`
3. Install `licensee` using the Ruby gem: `gem install --user-install licensee`
4. Run `licensee` on the `LICENSE` file (not the uncommitted changes
   repository): `cd repository;licensee detect LICENSE`.
5. If files like `COPYING` and `LICENSE` are properly selected, dual-licensed
   projects are also possible: "CC-BY-SA-4.0, GFDL-1.3 licenses found".

## The longer Explanation

1. When a license is selected during project creation, _github.com_
   automatically creates a license file named `LICENSE`. Selectable licenses
   are collected in the `_licenses` directory of the _choosealicense.com_
   repository:
   <https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/tree/gh-pages/_licenses>.
   These licenses should be recognized. The license file from _github.com_
   contains metadata about the license, such as an id called `spdx`.  Only
   licenses with an id will be detected. See
   <https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data> and
   <https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML> for details.

2. Sometimes a license is added later with a `LICENSE` file, or the license
   file has a different name. For example, `COPYING` is the `GNU` standard. I
   do not know which files are scanned (other than `COPYING` and `LICENSE`),
   but to be sure it might be advisable to rename the file to either `LICENSE`
   or `COPYING`. If both files exist, the project will display both licenses:
   "CC-BY-SA-4.0, GFDL-1.3 licenses found".

3. The content of the `LICENSE` file should be **text** with **78** characters
   per line. The best way to ensure this is to copy the contents of the license
   file found in the `_licenses` directory to `LICENSE`.

4. The Licensee Ruby gem <https://github.com/licensee/licensee> is used to
   query the license. To use it, the following requirements are necessary:

   - Recent Ruby version (2.7 for example, 2.3 will not work) (faraday-net_http
     requires Ruby version >= 2.6.0.)

   - A recent version of Debian (Bullseye will work; Stretch will not, even
     from package). An older Debian could use `aptitude insall ruby-licensee`
     to install `licensee`, but newer licenses may not be recognized and this
     binary seems to broken on Debian Stretch.

   - Even if you are considering installing from source, it is convenient to
     install the heavy dependencies from package, install as root using the
     command `aptitude install ruby-rugged`.

   - Use the `gem install` command.
   
   - Use the `--user-install` switch or add `gem: --user-install` to `~/gemrc`
     (tested) or use the `root` user (untested).

   - Add `~/.local/share/gem/ruby/2.7.0/bin` to your `PATH` if you are using
     Ruby 2.7.

   - If you want to install `licensee` from source. The dependencies are at
     least `rugby-dev`, `cmake` and maybe `libevent-pthreads-2.1-7`, but surely
     other dependencies need to be installed as well. This path has not been
     explored further on older systems or without installing `ruby-rugged`.

   - After running `gem install licensee`, the `licensee` binary can be found
     in `~/.local/share/gem/ruby/2.7.0/bin` or, if installed via package, in
     `/usr/bin/licensee`.

5. For example, in the <github.com/ckuelker/quick-guide-en-us> repository, the
   license file is named `LICENSE.markdown` and the content is GFDL-1.3 in
   markdown format. The original idea was to use this file for a CMS to display
   the license, but this idea was later abandoned. However,
   <https://github.com> reports the license as `View License`. So while
   `licensee` can detect the license, either the 99.16% accuracy is not high
   enough or the `*.markdown` extension prevents automatic detection.

    ```bash
    cd github.com/ckuelker/quick-guide
    ~/.local/share/gem/ruby/2.7.0/bin/licensee detect .
    License:        GFDL-1.3
    Matched files:  LICENSE.markdown
    LICENSE.markdown:
      Content hash:  82840a8d2e4f2a671f952b01b4971fa8a0ca4082
      Confidence:    99.16%
      Matcher:       Licensee::Matchers::Dice
      License:       GFDL-1.3
      Closest non-matching licenses:
        GFDL-1.3 similarity:  99.16%
        LGPL-2.1 similarity:  36.80%
        ODbL-1.0 similarity:  31.60%
    ```

6. Other projects have a better match and are recognized by
   <https://github.com>, such as <github.com/ckuelker/gitolite-tools>.

    ```bash
    cd github.com/ckuelker/gitolite-tools
    ~/.local/share/gem/ruby/2.7.0/bin/licensee detect .
    License:        GPL-3.0
    Matched files:  LICENSE
    LICENSE:
      Content hash:  7d4cdf499d39e2e1ce27b2878e22872f0f5a74dd
      Confidence:    100.00%
      Matcher:       Licensee::Matchers::Exact
      License:       GPL-3.0
    ```

7. Even if the file is not `LICENSE.markdown` but `LICENSE` and the content is
   markdown but not text, <https://github.com> will not detect it.

    ```bash
    cd github.com/ckuelker/www.pankyll.org
    License:        GFDL-1.3
    Matched files:  LICENSE
    LICENSE:
      Content hash:  82840a8d2e4f2a671f952b01b4971fa8a0ca4082
      Confidence:    99.16%
      Matcher:       Licensee::Matchers::Dice
      License:       GFDL-1.3
      Closest non-matching licenses:
        GFDL-1.3 similarity:  99.16%
        LGPL-2.1 similarity:  36.80%
        ODbL-1.0 similarity:  31.60%
    ```

    After changing the format of the `LICENSE` file from markdown to text, the
    detection of the project is still 99.16%. My guess is that it is checking
    against the repository and not against the uncommitted changes.

    ```bash
    cd github.com/ckuelker/www.pankyll.org
    ~/.local/share/gem/ruby/2.7.0/bin/licensee detect .
    License:        GFDL-1.3
    Matched files:  LICENSE
    LICENSrE:
      Content hash:  82840a8d2e4f2a671f952b01b4971fa8a0ca4082
      Confidence:    99.16%
      Matcher:       Licensee::Matchers::Dice
      License:       GFDL-1.3
      Closest non-matching licenses:
        GFDL-1.3 similarity:  99.16%
        LGPL-2.1 similarity:  36.80%
        ODbL-1.0 similarity:  31.60%
    ```

    When a file is explicitly requested to be scanned, the scanning rate
    changes.

    ```bash
    cd github.com/ckuelker/www.pankyll.org
    ~/.local/share/gem/ruby/2.7.0/bin/licensee detect LICENSE
    License:        GFDL-1.3
    Matched files:  LICENSE
    LICENSE:
      Content hash:  164a858691ea0a6fb0dd06c5ca00e5dd7620eef8
      Confidence:    100.00%
      Matcher:       Licensee::Matchers::Exact
      License:       GFDL-1.3
    ```

8. After committing the change to
   <https://github.com/ckuelker/www.pankyll.org>, the license value changed to
   "GFDL-1.3 license". So we can conclude that 99.16% is not enough. A
   subsequent git pull on another machine showed that project detection worked
   with the updated `LICENSE` file.

    ```bash
    cd github.com/ckuelker/www.pankyll.org
    ~/.local/share/gem/ruby/2.7.0/bin/licensee detect .
    License:        GFDL-1.3
    Matched files:  LICENSE
    LICENSE:
      Content hash:  164a858691ea0a6fb0dd06c5ca00e5dd7620eef8
      Confidence:    100.00%
      Matcher:       Licensee::Matchers::Exact
      License:       GFDL-1.3
    ```

9. These experiments are not complete, but may help.
