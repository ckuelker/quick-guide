Description:  Python Internationalization and localization

---

Internationalization (i18n) refers to the process of making a program aware of
multiple languages. Localization (l10n) refers to the process of adapting your
program, once internationalized, to the local language and cultural customs. A
locale is a set of internationalization parameters that defines a computer
user's language, region, and any special variant preferences that the user
wishes to see displayed in the user interface of programs, scripts, or the
desktop.  Sometimes the locale consists of a language code, like `en`, `de`,
but more often it is a combination of a language code and a country/region
code, like `en_EN` or `de_DE`. This is because some countries speak more than
one language. Often a `codeset` information (which character set to use) and a
modifier is added. On `POSIX` systems this results in a string like
`language[_territory][.codeset][@modifier]`.

Example:

- German language in Germany written in UTF-8: `de_DE.UTF-8`
- German language in Belgium written in ISO-8859: `de_BE.ISO-8859-1`
- German language in Belgium written in ISO-8859 with the EURO symbol:
  `de_BE.ISO-8859-15@euro` often shorted to `de_BE5@euro` as the EURO symbol is
  an option in ISO-8859 but not in UTF-8.

## Internationalization

Often `GNU gettext` or a similar system is used. The approach consists of several steps:

1. A program is written with special tags or functions known to `gettext`, such
   as `_`. Each call to print is processed by `gettext`. So print works as a
   wrapper for `gettext`.  The usual `print("text")` becomes
   `print(_("text"))`.

2. The `gettext` framework provides scripts that can extract strings that are
   parameters to the `_` function. So in the above case it would extract
   "text".  These strings, usually in English, but any other language will do,
   are called `msgid` and become the ID of a text. So here we have the message
   ID: `msg_id "text"`. These message IDs are collected in a file with the
   extension `*.pot` (PO template) and other useful information are collected
   too.

3. Step 1 and 2 are basically the internationalization of a program.  The next
   step is the localization. Here `gettext` is used to create a local version.
   This is basically a copy from `*.pot` to `*.po`. In case of British English
   it would be `en_GB.UTF-8.po` and in case of German spoken in Germany it
   would be `de_DE.UTF-8.po`. Next to the `msg_id` entry you will find a
   `msgstr ""` entry. For a localization to be complete, you need to translate
   the `msgid` to the `msgstr`. For German this would be `msid "Text"` and
   `msgstr "Text"`.

4. In theory the localization is done. However some programs would like to have
   the translated string database in a binary format. There are also tools in
   the `gettext` framework available to convert the `*.po` file to a binary
   format. Usually they have the extension `*.mo`.

## GNU gettext

Consider the following Python program `main`:

```python
import gettext
_ = gettext.gettext

def print_some_strings():
    print(_("Hello world"))
    print(_("Internationalisation"))

if __name__=='__main__':
    print_some_strings()
```

The corresponding `*.pot` file would look like:

```po
  # SOME DESCRIPTIVE TITLE.
  # Copyright (C) YEAR ORGANIZATION
  # FIRST AUTHOR <EMAIL@ADDRESS>, YEAR.
  #
msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Project-Id-Version: PACKAGE VERSION\n"
"POT-Creation-Date: 2022-01-28 16:47+0000\n"
"PO-Revision-Date: YEAR-MO-DA HO:MI+ZONE\n"
"Last-Translator: FULL NAME <EMAIL@ADDRESS>\n"
"Language-Team: LANGUAGE <LL@li.org>\n"
"MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"
"Generated-By: pygettext.py 1.5\n"

#: src/main.py:5
msgid "Hello world"
msgstr ""

#: src/main.py:6
msgid "Internationalisation"
msgstr ""
```

This is translated from reference English (whatever the developer wants) to the
target language (for example, English spoken in the United States of America).
In this case it is just a copy of strings.

```po
# English translations for PACKAGE package.
# Copyright (C) 2022 THE PACKAGE'S COPYRIGHT HOLDER
# This file is distributed under the same license as the PACKAGE package.
# Automatically generated, 2022.
#
msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Project-Id-Version: PACKAGE VERSION\n"
"Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: \n"
"POT-Creation-Date: 2022-05-18 06:38+0200\n"
"PO-Revision-Date: 2022-05-20 17:16+0200\n"
"Last-Translator: Automatically generated\n"
"Language-Team: none\n"
"Language: en_US\n"
"MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"
"Plural-Forms: nplurals=2; plural=(n != 1);\n"

#: src/main.py:5
msgid "Hello world"
msgstr "Hello world"

#: src/main.py:6
msgid "Internationalisation"
msgstr "Internationalization"
```

In short:

2. Create `*.pot`: `xgettext --no-wrap --from-code=UTF-8 --keyword=_ -L Python
   --copyright-holder='NAME' --package-name='main.py' -package-version='0.1.0'
   --output=main.pot main.py`
3. Create `*.po`: `msginit --no-wrap --no-translator --input=main.pot
   --locale=en_US -o en_US.po`
3. Update `*.po` from `*.pot`: `msgmerge --no-wrap --backup=none --update
   main.po main.pot`
4. Create `*.mo` from `*.po`: `msgfmt -o en_US.mo main.pot`


While the above is possible it is more common to store the `*.mo` files
differently, like:

~~~
locale
├── de_DE
│   └── LC_MESSAGES
│       ├── main.mo
│       └── main.po
├── en_US
│   └── LC_MESSAGES
│       ├── main.mo
│       └── main.po
├── ja_JP
│   └── LC_MESSAGES
│       ├── main.mo
│       └── main.po
└── main.pot

~~~

## Jinja2

To use `*.mo` file in Python with `jinja2` one can use the extension:
`jinja2.ext.i18n`

```python
env = Environment(loader=file_loader,extensions=["jinja2.ext.i18n"])
```

This allows the usage of `gettext` and `ngettext` function calls in the
template.

```jinja2
{{ getext('Hello World') }}
```

It is also possible to configure `jinja2` to use a default call or to
rename the function call.

## Limitations

This document describes the basics of `GNU gettext`. Advanced usage like
__numbers__, __singular__ and __plural__ or `ngettext` has not been touched.
