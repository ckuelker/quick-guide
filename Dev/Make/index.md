Compiling software, or building software, is a process that is done over and
over again, so build automation is one of the earliest tasks in software
development. Introduced in 1976, Make is a powerful tool that builds executable
programs and libraries from source code by reading a file called a `Makefile`.
The `Makefile` is the receipt that tells make what to compile and its
dependencies.
