## Introduction

Writing a line with equal signs or hyphens in Perl or Python is straight
forward. However doing this in bash bash required a different `printf`
format string.

## String Composed of 80 Equals

Perl

```perl
my $line = "=" x 80;
```

Python

```python
line = "=" * 80
```

Bash

```bash
line=$(printf '=%.0s' {1..80})
```

## String Composed of 80 Hyphens

Unlike 'String Composed of 80 Equals' the solution has to be different,
otherwise `printf` gets confused.

Perl

```perl
my $line = "-" x 80;
```

Python

```python
line = "-" * 80
```

Bash

```bash
line=$(printf '%0.s-' {1..80})
```
