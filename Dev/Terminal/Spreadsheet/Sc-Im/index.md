## Introduction

SC-IM, or Spreadsheet Calculator Improvised, is a modern reincarnation of the
classic spreadsheet calculator tool, originally known as SC. This Linux-based
application inherits its foundational design from the original SC, developed by
James Gosling and Mark Weiser, and further enhanced by Chuck Martin. SC-IM
stands out as a vim-like, ncurses-based spreadsheet program, tailored for users
who appreciate the efficiency and keyboard-driven operation typical of the Vim
editor.

## Releases

As of January 31, 2024, the most recent version of SC-IM is v0.8.3, released on
January 12, 2023. This version can be downloaded from
[http://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im]. As of this writing, there are no
official Debian packages available for this release.

## Build From Source Debian 12 Bookworm [0.1.1]

### Dependencies

Before initiating the build process, ensure that all necessary dependencies are
installed. On Debian 12 Bookworm, the required dependencies can be installed
using the following command:

```bash
# Choose from lua5.4 lua5.3 lua5.2 lua5.1
aptitude install yacc ncurses-dev bison gcc make pkg-config \
                 libxlsxwriter-dev libxml2-dev libzip-dev lua5.4

```

### Build

As root

```bash
mkdir -p /srv/{src,build}
chown $USER:$GROUP /srv/{src,build}
```

As $USER

```bash
cd /srv/src
wget https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im/archive/refs/tags/v0.8.3.tar.gz
cd /srv/build
tar xvzf ../src/v0.8.3.tar.gz
cd sc-im-0.8.3
# You might have a look at src/Makefile to match your architecture. For me and
# Debian 12 it seems to match
make -C src
make: Entering directory '/srv/build/sc-im-0.8.3/src'
yacc -d gram.y
mv y.tab.c gram.c
sed -f eres.sed < gram.y > experres.h
sed -f sres.sed < gram.y > statres.h
[...]
make: Leaving directory '/srv/build/sc-im-0.8.3/src
```

You will find `sc-im` in `/srv/build/sc-im-0.8.3/src`.

Optionally you might install it with `make -C src install` (not tested).
