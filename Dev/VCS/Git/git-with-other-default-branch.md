description: How to create a new git repository with a non default branch

---

Sometimes the default branch name is not the name you want. However this branch
name is hard-coded into `git`. One way to circumvent the usage of the
hard-coded default branch, is to create a virtual new branch __before__ the
first commit.

When a new `git` repository is created the `HEAD` file is at that moment  a
pointer to the (virtual) default branch. One can easily find out with `cat` to
what it points. The trick is to change the pointer for `HEAD` __before__ the
first commit and therefore before the default branch exists and making the new
virtual first branch the default branch.

For all steps we assume a new repository was created similar to this approach.

```bash
cd /tmp

mkdir test

cd test

git init
```

(`VS;PR`) Now the __very short__ process to crate a git repository with a
different default branch, without explanations, so __please read__ it.

```bash
cd /tmp

mkdir test

cd test

git init

git checkout --orphan main
```

(`ATL;DR`) The next example is basically (allmost) the same, but include some
commands to prove it and explanations on what to expect.

```bash
cd /tmp

mkdir test

cd test

git init                   # HEAD points to non existing ref: refs/heads/master

cat .git/HEAD              # Should give ref: refs/heads/master

ls .git/refs/heads         # Should give nothing

git checkout --orphan main # HEAD points to non existing ref: refs/heads/main

cat .git/HEAD              # Should give ref: refs/heads/main

ls .git/refs/heads         # Should give nothing (will change after commit)
```

(`TL;DR`) And finally the following session shows what happens, if there is a
first commit to the repository, including the output of all commands.

```bash
cd /tmp

mkdir test

cd test

git init                   # HEAD points to non existing ref: refs/heads/master
Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/test/.git/

cat .git/HEAD              # Should give ref: refs/heads/master
ref: refs/heads/master

ls .git/refs/heads         # Should give nothing

git checkout --orphan main # HEAD points to non existing ref: refs/heads/main
Switched to a new branch 'main'

cat .git/HEAD              # Should give ref: refs/heads/main
ref: refs/heads/main

ls .git/refs/heads         # Should give nothing (will change after commit)

touch README.md            # Will create the file README.md

git add README.md          # Make the file known to git

                           # Create a commit and in unison the new branch
                           # under a non default name
git commit -m init README.md
[main (root-commit) 9fdf194] init
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 README.md

cat .git/HEAD              # Should give ref: refs/heads/main
ref: refs/heads/main

ls .git/refs/heads         # Should give main
main
```

As one can see `ls .git/refs/heads` now shows that the new branch came into
existence.
