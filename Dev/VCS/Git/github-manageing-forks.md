## Introduction

There are several ways to manage forks. One way is to manage forks through the
web interface. While this has the advantage of no additional configuration in
the forked repository, it has the disadvantage of a complex workflow and cannot
be applied in all cases. In addition, it requires opening multiple views
(browser tabs) of different repositories, which in some cases can lead to a
pull request being opened in the wrong repository. And, of course, those
requests cannot be deleted, marking the error forever. Therefore, this document
describes a different method that uses the command line and the additional
configuration of an upstream remote source.

## Forking/ Merging

__Fork/Merge the upstream__

Forking (GitHub) or merging (GitLab) the upstream needs to be done before the
management. While the naming between GitHub and GitLab is different the concept
is similar. So for now I use GitHub as an example: After logging into GitHub
via the <https://github.com> web interface, browse to the project to be forked
and use the drop down button 'fork' and choose '+ create a new fork'.  Enter a
new fork name (repository name) and decide if you copy only the default branch
or not. In some cases it has to be __not__ checked, because the default branch
is not the development branch. This depends on the repositories policy.  Then
clone the fork to your local working space. More details can be found in the
document [GitHub Pull Requests](github-pull-request.md).

## Management - To Long To Read - TLTR

__Set up a managing fork via upstream__  (drawback, local repo will be ahead)

```bash
git remote show
git remote add upstream https://github.com/whoever/whatever.git
git remote show
git remote show upstream
```

__Update a fork via 'upstream'__ (Update only, no local commits expected)

```bash
git remote show upstream # make sure the result is 'fast-forwardable'
git fetch upstream
git branch -va # make sure if the branches are not changed (e.g. main->dev)
export B=$(git branch -va|grep 'origin/HEAD'|sed -e 's%.*remotes/origin/HEAD.*->\s\+origin/%%g')
git checkout $B # See if $B is main/develop/...: see remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/BRANCH
git merge upstream/$B # See if $B is main/develop/...
git push
```

If done via the GUI (_"Fetch upstream"_), it will also add a merge commit like
_"Merge branch 'corona-warn-app:release/2.24.x' into development"_ (if the HEAD
points to development) and leave the repository +1 commits ahead.

## Adding A Remote Upstream

To understand the current state of a git repository - any repository, forked or
not - you can use the git remote command.

```bash
git remote show
origin
```

Usually it just shows the word `origin` if the repository is a fork. If you
specify the name `origin`, more information can be displayed.

```bash
git remote show origin
```

For the repository `cwa-documentation` it will give for example:

```bash
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: git@github.com:ckuelker/cwa-documentation.git
  Push  URL: git@github.com:ckuelker/cwa-documentation.git
  HEAD branch: main
  Remote branches:
    SabineLoss-patch-1                                   tracked
    SabineLoss-patch-2                                   tracked
    fix/typo-overview-security.md-identification-against tracked
    main                                                 tracked
  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
    main merges with remote main
  Local refs configured for 'git push':
    fix/typo-overview-security.md-identification-against pushes to \
fix/typo-overview-security.md-identification-against (up to date)
    main                                                 pushes to \
main                                                 (up to date)
```

After the configuration details for pushing and fetching, and the current state
of where the repository head is pointing at (main), information about remote
and local branches is displayed.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/whoever/whatever.git
```

Example:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation.git
```

To confirm that a remote entity has been successfully added, the `git remote`
command is useful.

```bash
git remote show
origin
upstream
```

It should show the word `upstream`.

Similar to the `remote origin` information, detailed information about the
`remote upstream` can be displayed using the `git remote show upstream`
command.

For the `cwa-documentation` repository the upstream information looks as
follows:

```bash
git remote show upstream
* remote upstream
  Fetch URL: https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation.git
  Push  URL: https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation.git
  HEAD branch: main
  Remote branches:
    SabineLoss-patch-1                           tracked
    SabineLoss-patch-2                           tracked
    fix/typo-backend-infrastructure-architecture tracked
    main                                         tracked
    tkowark-patch-1                              tracked
    tune_linting                                 tracked
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    main pushes to main (fast-forwardable)
```

The above shows a current situation. The following shows an out-of-sync
situation (output truncated):

```bash
  ...
  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
    main merges with remote main
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    main pushes to main (local out of date)
```

## Updating the Fork

There is more than one way to update a fork. In trivial cases, the git
repository GUI (e.g. <https://github.com>) provides a method to do this. Since
this may change with a new release of the GUI, a more general method is to add
a remote upstream, fetch the upstream, checkout main, and merge upstream and
main.

It is not absolutely necessary to keep the fork current. If you are working on
anything more than a tiny, quick fix, make sure you keep your fork up to date
by tracking the original upstream repo you forked from. To do this, you'll need
to add a remote:

```bash
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/UPSTREAM-USER/ORIGINAL-PROJECT.git
```

Verify the new remote named 'upstream' with `git remote -v`. See this example
for `cwa-documentation.git`.

```bash
git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:ckuelker/cwa-documentation.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:ckuelker/cwa-documentation.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation.git (push)
```

Update the repository with the latest changes from upstream: fetch the latest
commits and branches.

```bash
$ git fetch upstream
````

View all branches, including those from upstream

```bash
$ git branch -va
```

Or if you would like to automate the search.

```bash
export B=$(git branch -va|grep 'origin/HEAD'|sed -e 's%.*remotes/origin/HEAD.*->\s\+origin/%%g')
```

Check out the main branch and merge it into the upstream repository's main
branch.  Sometimes the main branch is called "main", sometimes other names such
as "development".

```bash
$ git checkout $B
$ git merge upstream/$B
```

If there are no unique commits on the local main branch, git will simply
fast-forward. However, if changes have been made to the source (upstream)
repository (which you probably should not do), conflicts may occur. Be careful
with upstream changes. If changes have been made upstream, you should consider
2 options. One is to simply follow upstream. In this case, only update the fork
when your pull request has been successfully merged into the upstream
repository. Or second is to develop new software based on the fork. In this
case, synchronizing the fork should be done in a less controlled way. If you
find yourself in the second category, and are forced to do many, large, and
complex synchronizations to your fork, you should consider abandoning your fork
and contributing to the upstream repository.

```bash
$ git push
```

## Additional Steps

You are done if you just forked the other repository. The next steps depend on
(1) what you did with the fork: history, and (2) what you intend to do with it:
usage.

The history question (1) can be divided into:

1. Nothing (no changes, just a fork)
2. Changes (changes in the work tree: nothing added or committed)
3. Add changes
4. Add changes and committed
5. Add changes and committed and created a pull request
6. Add changes and committed and created a pull request that was accepted

The use question (2) can be divided into:

1. Users should be able to use a fork with a pristine commit history
2. Users should be able to use a fork with a different commit history
