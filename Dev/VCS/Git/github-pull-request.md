description: How to make a github.com pull request

---

A common way participating in software projects managed with git is the so
called 'pull request' on certain services like <https://github.com> (It is
called 'merge request on <https://gitlab.com>). This technique is very popular
with git, as people often have a one time commitment and no write access to the
repository. A 'pull request' is therefore a one time __write__ exception to the
repository. In traditional `VCS` a tar ball was send via mail for example and
the repository maintainer would manually save the tar ball to the file system,
extract the content and add the changes to the repository, review it, make a
diff and decide if the changes would be included in the next repository commit
to make a one time contribution possible. This was a labour intensive error
prone process. Git and <https://github.com> use the concept of a 'pull
request' and 'fork' to facilitate a half automatic method for one time write
contribution. This section is about how to make a pull request (and fork) on
<https://github.com> specific. As this is not a git feature as such, the web
interface of <https://github.com> need to be used together with the command
line.

1. Log into <https://github.com>
2. Go to the web page projects repository, press the fork button
3. Clone **your** fork of the repository

```bash
user@host:~$ git clone git@github.com:USER/REPOSITORY.git
```

4. Enter the REPOSITORY

```bash
user@host:~$ cd REPOSITORY
```

5. Switch to the master branch (your branch should be diverted from master) and
look for the other branches, so that your new name do not conflict. For
example.

```bash
user@host:~$ git checkout master
user@host:~$ git branch -a
* master
remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
remotes/origin/SabineLoss-patch-1
remotes/origin/SabineLoss-patch-2
remotes/origin/master
```

6. Crate a new self descriptive branch with a `BRANCHNAME`

```bash
git branch BRANCHNAME
```

7. Switch to the new branch

```bash
git checkout BRACHNAME
```

The short form of the last 2 steps, create a self descriptive branch of
intended change.

```bash
user@host:~$ git checkout -b BRANCHNAME
```

For example

```bash
user@host:~$ git checkout -b fix/typo-overview-security.md-identification-against
```

Make sure you are at your branch (example from above)

```bash
user@host:~$ git branch -a
* fix/typo-overview-security.md-identification-against
  master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/SabineLoss-patch-1
  remotes/origin/SabineLoss-patch-2
  remotes/origin/master
```

8. Create very few commits with **good** commit messages

```bash
user@host:~$ sed -i -e 's%A%B%' file.md
user@host:~$ git commit -m 'typo (A -> B)' file.md
```

9. Cleanup the branch before pushing

10. Pushing the branch to `github.com`

When using just `git push` you will get an error message like this

```bash
user@host:~$ git push
fatal: The current branch BRANCHNAME has no upstream branch. To push the
current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin BRANCHNAME
```

However you can just push it with a one time statement

```bash
user@host:~$ git push origin BRANCHNAME
```

Example

```bash
user@host:~$ git push origin fix/typo-overview-security.md-identification-against

remote: Create a pull request for
        'fix/typo-overview-security.md-identification-against' on GitHub by
        visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/ckuelker/cwa-documentation/pull/new/\
             fix/typo-overview-security.md-identification-against
remote:
To github.com:ckuelker/cwa-documentation.git
 * [new branch]      fix/typo-overview-security.md-identification-against -> \
                     fix/typo-overview-security.md-identification-against
```

11. Request A Pull

The last commit already shows the URL to go
`https://github.com/UPSTREAM-USER/UPSTREAM-REPO/pull/new/BRANCHNAME`. Use the
URL and press the green button "Compare & pull request". Add a message.

## Understanding The Remote Origin

```bash
user@host:~$ git remote show origin
```

Example

```bash
user@host:~$ git remote show origin
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: git@github.com:ckuelker/cwa-testresult-server
  Push  URL: git@github.com:ckuelker/cwa-testresult-server
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branches:
    fix/no-nullable-result                          tracked
    fix/typo-docs-architecture-overview.md-security tracked
    master                                          tracked
  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
    master merges with remote master
  Local refs configured for 'git push':
    fix/typo-docs-architecture-overview.md-security pushes to \
      fix/typo-docs-architecture-overview.md-security (up to date)
    master                                          pushes to master \
                                           (up to date)
```

## Delete An Unused Branch

Sometimes while working on the pull request one realize that the name of the
branch is not fit for the purpose, needs an addition. Usually the `-d` option
is used.

```bash
user@host:~$ git branch -d BRANCHNAME
```

However if the branch is not merged `-D` needs to be used.

```bash
user@host:~$ git branch -D BRANCHNAME
```
