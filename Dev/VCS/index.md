description: Version or Revision Control Systems are used to manage source code

---

__Version Control__ [ðŸ¡† VC] is used to manage changes to information. This
information comes in the form of documents, computer programs, software
sources, large web sites, and others. Changes are usually identified by a
number (e.g. 1.0, 1.1, ...) or letter code (A, B, ...) called a "revision
number" or simply "revision". The terms "version control", "revision control",
"revision control system" (RCS), "version control system" [ðŸ¡† VCS], or "source
control" are synonymous. This document and subsequent documents refer to this
general concept.  However, there is a specific implementation of the same name
[ðŸ¡† GNU-RCS] which is not covered here.

- VCS = RCS (VC = VCS = SC = RCS = RC != GNU RCS)

Recently, a special kind of [ðŸ¡† VCS]/RCS has emerged: __Distributed Version
Control Systems__ ([ðŸ¡† DVCS]) or __Distributed Revision Control Systems__
(DRCS).  While [ðŸ¡† Arch], [ðŸ¡† Monotone], and [ðŸ¡† Darcs] have been around for some
time, [ðŸ¡† Git] or [ðŸ¡† Mercurial] recently made [ðŸ¡† DVCS]/DRCS popular.

- DVCS = DRCS
- Git | Mercurial | Darcs | Montone | Arch

In the following documents, the term __Version Control System__ `(VCS)` is used
for all of these terms. Information about the following [ðŸ¡† VCS] can be found:
