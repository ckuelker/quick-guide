description: Version or Revision Control Systems are used to manage source code

---

__Version control__ [ðŸ¡† VC] is used to manage information changes. This
information comes in form of documents, computer programs, software sources,
large web sites and others. Changes are usually identified by a number (e.g.
1.0, 1.1, ..) or letter code (A, B, ..), refered to as the "revision number",
or simply "revision". The terms "version control", "revision control",
"revision control system" (RCS), version control system [ðŸ¡† VCS] or "source
control" are synonymous. This and subsequent documents refer to this general
concept.  However there is a specific implementation under the same name [ðŸ¡†
GNU-RCS] which is not covered.

- VCS = RCS (VC = VCS = SC = RCS = RC != GNU RCS)

Recently a special kind of [ðŸ¡† VCS]/ RCS emerged the **Distributed Version
Control Systems** ([ðŸ¡† DVCS]) or respective **Distributed Revision Control
Systems** (DRCS).  While [ðŸ¡† Arch], [ðŸ¡† Monotone], and [ðŸ¡† Darcs] existed for some
time only recently [ðŸ¡† Git] or [ðŸ¡† Mercurial] made [ðŸ¡† DVCS]/DRCS popular.

- DVCS = DRCS
- Git | Mercurial | Darcs | Montone | Arch

In subsequent documents for all this terms __Version Control System__ `(VCS)`
is used. Information about the following [ðŸ¡† VCS] can be found:
