    Iperf and Iperf3 are tools to measure network bandwidth and other network
    parameters

---

The [iperf] tool can be used to measure network performance. The current
version is [iperf3]. [Iperf] is a cross platform tool for active measurements
of the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP network protocols [TCP], [UDP] and
[SCTP] with IPv4 and IPv6. [iperf3] is a new implementation from scratch, with
the goal of a smaller, simpler code base, and a library version of the
functionality that can be used in other programs.

## Features

TCP and SCTP            | UDP
----------------------- | ----------------------
Bandwidth measurement   | creation of dedicated bandwidth streams
Report MSS/MTU size     | measure package loss
Observe MSS/MTU size    | measure delay jitter
Support TCP window size | use multicast

[iperf3] and specially [iperf3.1] has additional features compared to [iperf2].
However the following features are not available:

- -d/-r: Bidirectional testing
- -I: Data transmitted from stdin
- -T: Time-to-live (TTL), for multicast
- -x: Exclude C(connection) D(data) M(multicast) S(settings) V(server) reports
- -y: Report as a Comma-Separated Values
- -C: Compatibility mode allows for use with older version of [iPerf]

The [iperf2] has a nice brief [comparison table] which compares iperf2 and
iperf3.

## Debian Versions

Debian      | iperf           | iperf3
----------- | --------------- | ------
Bullseye 11 | 2.0.14a+dfsg1-1 | 3.9-1
Buster 10   | 2.0.12+dfsg1-2  | 3.6-2
Stretch 9   | 2.0.9+dfsg1-1   | 3.1.3-1

## Installation of Iperf 2.x

```bash
aptitude install iperf
```

## Installation of Iperf 3.x

```bash
aptitude install iperf3
```

## Command Line Completion

For command line completion `bash` can be used. If there is the file
`/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/iperf`, most likely completion will
work for `bash`.

## Usage Of Iperf

[iperf] is a client  and server application and used on two computers. One
takes the role as server the other the role as client.  [iperf] then send
packages over the network and measure the link or links in between the server
and the client. Usually on would limit the link count between server and client
to understand which link has what performance. Many operations are similar
between [iperf2] and [iperf3].

### Simple Iperf2 Example

This is a simple [TCP] client server bandwidth test.

Server:

```bash
iperf -s
```

Client:

```bash
iperf -c 192.168.168.32
------------------------------------------------------------
Client connecting to 192.168.168.32, TCP port 5001
TCP window size: 85.0 KByte (default)
------------------------------------------------------------
[  3] local 192.168.168.33 port 42152 connected with 192.168.168.32 port 5001
[ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth
[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec  1.09 GBytes   939 Mbits/sec
```

### MSS Iperf2 Example

Maximum Segment Size (-m argument) display:

The Maximum Segment Size (MSS) is the largest amount of data (often measured in
bytes) that a computer can transfer in a single, unfragmented TCP segment.

It can be calculated as follows:

- `MSS = MTU - TCP + IP headers`
- The `TCP + IP headers` are equal to 40 bytes.
- The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) is the greatest amount of data that
  can be transferred in a frame.

Some default MTU sizes for different network topologies:

- Ethernet - 1500 bytes: used in a LAN
- PPPoE - 1492 bytes: used on ADSL links

Generally speaking, higher MTU (and MSS) brings higher bandwidth efficiency

Server:

```bash
iperf -s
```

Client side:

```bash
iperf -c 192.167.168.32 -m
------------------------------------------------------------
Client connecting to 192.168.168.32, TCP port 5001
TCP window size: 16.0 KByte (default)
------------------------------------------------------------
[ 3] local 192.168.168.33 port 42384 connected with 192.168.168.32 port 5001
[ 3]   0.0-10.2 sec   1.27 MBytes   1.04 Mbits/sec
[ 3] MSS size 1448 bytes (MTU 1500 bytes, ethernet)
```

Here the MSS is not equal to `1500 - 40` but to `1500 - 40 - 12 (Timestamps
option) = 1448`
