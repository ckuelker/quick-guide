## Introduction

Compiling HPC components on a Raspberry Pi do not make sense, as the Raspberry
Pi is not powerful. However the way and consideration when building HPC
software components, like Atlas, is very similar as on Intel or AMD based HPC
systems. For educational purpose this document describes building Altlas 3 on
the Raspberry Pi 4. Be patient, compiling Atlas takes time and depends on
single core performance.

## rpi/la/atlas/3.10.3

This builds and installs Atlas 3.10.3 for the Raspberry Pi 4. However, except
setting a non throttling mode, this is similar to other architectures.

Atlas 3.10.3 from 2016 is still the latest (2022-06-18) version.

For this compilation [mpich](mpich.md) was installed first. Dependencies to
[mpich](mpich.md) are are not listed here.

For Atlas to be useful in HPC, consider a homogeneous cluster. Atlas should be
compiled from source for every hardware architecture as Atlas make timing
calculation during build time. The length of build depends highly on single
core performance. On a Raspberry Pi 4 8GB it can take 15hours and 44minutes,
while on a modern AMD 6hours and 30minutes.

Preparations as root

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/hpc/src
chown -R $USER.$USER /opt/hpc
apitude install cpufrequtils
```

Make sure you set the performance and disable CPU throttling. Assuming a
certain hardware you can get the numbers of cores via a command (or you have to
figure out via `/proc/cpuinfo`)

1. Either try `cpufreq` to disable throttling

```bash
numactl --hardware|grep cpus|sed -e 's%node 0 cpus:%%'
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
for c in `numactl --hardware|grep cpus|sed -e 's%node 0 cpus:%%'`;do\
/usr/bin/cpufreq-set -g performance $c;done
```

2. Or set `performance` manually:

```bash
numactl --hardware|grep cpus|sed -e 's%node 0 cpus:%%'
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

for c in `numactl --hardware|grep cpus|sed -e 's%node 0 cpus:%%'`;do\
echo performance|sudo /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu$c/cpufreq/scaling_governor;\
done

for c in `numactl --hardware|grep cpus|sed -e 's%node 0 cpus:%%'`;do \
echo -n "CPU $c ";cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu$c/cpufreq/scaling_governor;\
done
```

3. Or set via kernel parameter (as described in ATLAS/doc/atlas_install.pdf
   page 5 (not tested).

4. Or use `BLAS` (as performance can not be guaranteed anyways, it throttling
   can not be disabled.)

5. Or if you insist on ATLAS, disable timing with `--cripple-atlas-performance`

If throttling is __not__ disabled, and you are not using
`--cripple-atlas-performance`, you might see this error (copied from a non
Raspberry Pi):

~~~
ERROR: enum fam=0, chip=32765, model=113, mach=-1785083552
make[3]: *** [Makefile:106: atlas_run] Error 100
make[2]: *** [Makefile:449: IRunArchInfo_x86] Error 2
CPU Throttling apparently enabled!
~~~

Either check the above list, the Atlas PDF `doc/atlas_install.pdf` included in
the archive, the more up to date [online
documentation](http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/atlas_install/atlas_install.html),
use `BLAS` or compile with `--cripple-atlas-performance`.

When building Atlas, do not use the `-j` option, as this will mess up Atlas
timings. The make run will take some time. Make sure the system stays up that
long and is not used by other processes. It might make sense to execute it in
`screen` or `tmux`.
